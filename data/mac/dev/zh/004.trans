When my grandmother just turned sixteen, her father decided to marry Shan Bianlang, the only son of Shan Tingxiu, a well-known rich man in Northeast Gaomi Township.
Shanjia opens a shochu pot and uses cheap sorghum as raw materials to brew high-quality liquor, which is famous for a hundred li.
The terrain of Northeast Township is low-lying, and autumn water is often flooded. Sorghum stalks are used to prevent waterlogging. They are widely planted and have high yields every year.
A single family uses cheap raw materials to make wine for profit, and the rich one.
It is the honor of my great-grandfather that my grandma can marry Shan Bianlang.
At that time, many people were eager to get married with Shan's family, even though it was rumored that Shan Bianlang had already contracted leprosy.
Shan Tingxiu is a dry little old man with a withered pigtail behind his head.
His house is full of money, but he is dressed in rags and often tied a straw rope around his waist.
Grandma's marriage to Shan's family was actually God's will.
That day, my grandma was playing jokes with some big girls with pointed feet and long braids beside the swing. It was Ching Ming Festival, pink and willow green, drizzle, peach blossom, and daughter liberated.
Grandma was 1.60 meters tall and weighed 60 kilograms that year. She wore a floral dress and green satin trousers. She wore a crimson ribbon around her ankle.
Because of the light rain, grandma wore a pair of embroidered oil shoes soaked in tung oil more than ten times, and the Krone rang.
There was a big shiny braid hanging from the back of grandma's head, and a heavy silver lock hung around her neck—my great-grandfather was a small craftsman who made silverware.
The great-grandmother is the daughter of a ruinous master, and she knows the importance of small feet to women.
Grandma started to bind her feet when she was less than six years old, and she kept getting more and more serious.
A foot-wrap cloth, which is more than one foot long, was used by my great-grandmother to wean grandmother's foot bones and broke eight toes on the soles of her feet. What a misfortune!
My mother also has little feet. Every time I see her feet, I feel sad, and I can't wait to shout: Down with feudalism!
Long live the freedom of human feet!
Grandma suffered so much, and finally wrapped up a pair of three-inch golden lotus.
When she was sixteen, her grandmother was already plump and beautiful. She walked along with her arms waving and her waist twisting like a willow in the wind.
Shan Tingxiu carried a dung basket to my great-grandfather's village that day, and saw my grandma from the many flowers.
Three months later, I took my grandma away in the sedan chair.
Grandma was sitting in the depressed sedan chair, dizzy.
The red cloth on the hood covered her eyes, and there was a strong musty smell on the red cloth.
She raised her hand and lifted the red cloth-grandmother Zeng Qian told her not to lift the hood red cloth by herself-a heavy twisted silver bracelet slid onto her forearm, and grandma looked at the snake shape on the bracelet The pattern, my heart is chaotic.
The warm smoky wind blows the emerald green sorghum on both sides of the narrow dirt road.
From the sorghum field came the cries of pigeons.
The silver-gray sorghum ears that just showed up are flying with light pollen.
The car curtain facing her face is embroidered with dragon and phoenix patterns. The red cloth on the car curtain has been eclipsed by the sedan chair rented out over the years, and a large area of ​​oil stains in the middle.
In the late summer and early autumn, the sun was luxuriant, the light movement of the bearers made the sedan tremble, the cowhide tied to the poles squeaked, and the sedan curtain gently lifted, flashing wisps of light and relatively cool wind in. Come in the sedan chair.
Grandma was sweating all over her body, and her heartbeat was drumming. Listening to the uniform footsteps and heavy gasps of the bearers, the smooth cold like pebbles and the rough heat like peppers alternately appeared in her mind.
Ever since her grandmother was spotted by Shan Tingxiu, I don't know how many people have expressed their joy to their great-grandfather and great-grandmother.
Although grandma wants to have a good life of getting gold and silver, but she is looking forward to having a good son-in-law who is literate and understandable, has a clear eye, and knows cold and hot.
Grandma embroidered the wedding dress in her boudoir, embroidering exquisite pictures of my future grandfather.
She was looking forward to getting married at an early date, but from the words of her female partner, she vaguely heard that the son of Shan Jia was a leper patient. Grandma's heart was cold. Grandma told her parents about her worries.
The great-grandfather concealed himself from answering, but the great-grandmother scolded her grandma’s female companions, probably saying that the fox could not eat the grapes and said the grapes were sour.
His great-grandfather later said that the son of the Shan family was full of poems and books, staying at home, pure and pure, and showing talent.
Grandma was in a daze, not knowing the truth or not, thinking that there are no cruel parents in the world, maybe the female partner is really nonsense.
Grandma began to look forward to an early marriage.
Grandma's plump youth radiated intense anxiety and light loneliness. She longed to lie in the arms of a stalwart man to relieve anxiety and eliminate loneliness.
The wedding time finally arrived, and grandma was loaded into the four-person sedan. The big horn and the small suona blew miserably before and after the sedan chair. Grandma couldn't stop the tears streaming down her cheeks.
The sedan chair set off, flickering like clouds and fog, the lazy drummer stopped playing not far from the village, and the sedan chairmen quickly got up.
The taste of sorghum is deeply rooted in people's hearts
The rare birds in the sorghum field crowed low.
When a ray of sunlight entered the dim sedan chair, the image of her husband in her grandma's heart gradually became clear.
Her heart seemed to be pierced by a needle, the pain was profound and powerful.
"God, bless me!"
The prayers in grandma's heart moved her lips.
There is a thin layer of hair on grandma's lips.
The grandmother is tender and lush, with plenty of water.
The whispers she uttered were completely absorbed by the heavy car wall and curtain.
She tore off the sour hood and put it on her lap.
In accordance with the tradition of marriage, grandma also wore three new cotton-padded jackets and trousers in hot weather.
The sedan chair is in tatters and filthy.
It is like a coffin, I don't know how many brides who must become dead bodies have been installed.
The yellow satin lining on the car wall was dirty and greasy. Three of the five flies were buzzing on the tits, and two of them were lying on the car curtain, wiping their bright eyes with their black rod-shaped legs.
Feeling bored, grandma quietly stretched out her pointed feet and opened a gap on the top of the car curtain.
Look out secretly.
She saw the faintly discernible, graceful long legs in the fat black silk trousers of the bearers, and the fat feet in pair of nose bridge hemp shoes.
There was a puff of dust on the foot of the bearer.
Grandma guessed the sturdy upper body of the bearer, couldn't help but move her toes up and leaned forward.
She saw the smooth acacia wood chair pole and the bearer's broad shoulders.
On both sides of the road, the slab-like sorghum is solid and stagnant, connected as a whole, crowded, and looking at each other, the gray-green sorghum ears are still sleepy, and this ear is indistinguishable from the other. The sorghum never ends, as if gurgling and flowing. river.
The road is sometimes very narrow, and the sorghum leaves covered with aphid secretions make the rustle on both sides of the sedan chair.
The bearer was sour and sweaty. Grandma was breathing the man's scent obsessively. There must be waves of spring in her heart.
The bearer lifts the sedan chair and walks from the street. They are called "walking on the street". On the one hand, they are to please the owner and get more rewards; on the other hand, they are to show an elegant professional demeanor. .
When stepping on the street, it’s not a hero who walks unevenly, and it’s not a hero who holds the bar of the sedan chair. The qualified bearers have their hands stuck at the waist, and the pace is the same. The rhythm of the sedan chair must match the poignant music played by the drummers. People can realize that there is an equal amount of pain hidden behind any happiness.
When the sedan chair went to the Pingchuan wilderness, the sedan chairmen strayed into the wild, this was to drive the road, and the other was to toss the bride.
Some brides were thrown up loudly by the sedan chair, and the dirt was full of embroidered shoes; the bearers got a kind of venting pleasure in the sound of the bride's vomiting.
These young and strong men must not feel like the sacrifice in the bridal chamber for others, so they have to toss the bride.
One of the four bearers who carried my grandma that day became my grandfather-he was Commander Yu Zhan'ao.
At that time, he was 20 years old, and he was a leader in the trade of coffin and sedan chair in Northeast Township
——The heroes of my grandfather’s generation all have a distinctive personality like sorghum from Gaomi Northeast Township, which is not comparable to our weak younger generations——
The rules at that time, the bearers joking with the bride on the road, just like the guys on the shochu pot drinking shochu, it is a matter of course, and the brides of the king and Laozi dare to toss.
The sorghum leaves grind the sedan chair to a loud noise. From the depths of the sorghum, a melodious cry suddenly came, breaking the monotony on the road.
The cry is very similar to the tunes played by drummers.
When grandma thought of music, she thought that those bleak instruments must be carried by the drummers.
With her feet on the car curtain, grandma can see the waist of a bearer wet with sweat. Grandma sees her feet wearing red embroidered shoes more. It is pointed and thin, with a sad expression, cast from the outside. The incoming light covers them.
They are like two lotus petals, they are more like two little goldfish lying in ambush in the clear water.
Two drops of sorghum grains of crystal and reddish tears jumped out of grandma's eyelashes, flowed across the cheeks, and flowed to the corners of the mouth.
The grandmother was sad and bitter in her heart. The image of her husband who was always portrayed as the same as the characters on the stage, Eguan Boss, and elegant and romantic, was first blurred in tears and then disappeared.
Grandma saw Shan Jiabianlang's blossoming leprosy face in terror, and her grandma was cold from heart.
Grandma thought that these delicate golden lotus, this peach-faced apricot face, thousands of warmth, thousands of romantic, is it really necessary for a leper to eliminate it?
As it is, it is better to die.
The long cries in the sorghum fields were mixed with lumpy words:
Blue sky-blue sky-colorful sky-big mallet, brother, you are dead-but my sister's sky has collapsed-
I have to tell you that our Gaomi Dongbeixiang women crying for fun are as beautiful as singing.
In the first year of the Republic of China, the "crying households" of the Confucius family in Qufu County made a special trip to learn how to cry.
On the day of rejoicing, she ran into a woman crying for her deceased husband. Grandma felt that this was an ominous sign, and her already heavy heart became even heavier.
At this time, a bearer spoke: "Little lady on the sedan, say a few words to your brothers!
The far distance is so boring. "
Grandma quickly picked up the red cloth, covered her head, and quietly retracted her toes against the car curtain, and the car was completely dark again.
"Sing a song for my brothers, my brother will carry you!"
The drummer woke up like a dream, and blew the big horn suddenly behind the sedan chair. The big horn said:
"Boom—Boom—"
"Fierce stabbing——Fierce stabbing——"
Someone in front of the sedan mimicked the sound of a horn and said, there was a rough laughter from the front and back.
Grandma was dripping with sweat.
Before entering the sedan chair, her great-grandmother repeatedly warned her not to quarrel with the bearers on the road.
Bearers and trumpeters are all inferior, treacherous and weird, and they can do all kinds of bad things.
The bearers vigorously shook the palanquin, the grandmother's buttocks were unsteady, and her hands grasped the seat board.
"No voice?
Bump!
If you can't tell her, you'll get her pee! "
The sedan chair was already like a boat in the wind and waves. Grandma grasped the seat plate stubbornly, and the two eggs she ate in the morning were churning in her belly. Flies buzzed around her ears, her throat was tense, and the smell of eggs rushed into her mouth. She bit her lip.
Can't vomit, can't vomit!
Grandma ordered herself not to vomit, Fenglian. People say that vomiting in the sedan chair is the biggest unlucky thing. If you throw up the sedan chair, you will have no luck in your life...
The bearers' words are even more crude. Some of them call my great-grandfather a villain who sees money, some say that flowers are stuck in cow dung, and some say that Shan Bianlang is a leper with white pus and yellow water.
They said that standing outside the yard of a single family could smell a smell of rotten meat. In the yard of a single family, swarms of blow flies were flying...
"Little lady, you can't let Shan Bianlang get on your body, if you get on your body, you will suck too!"
The big trumpet Suona whimpered and whimpered, and the smell of eggs became stronger. Grandma's teeth bit her lip, and her throat seemed to be hitting like a fist. She couldn't help it, a mouth, a rush of dirt Coming out, painted on the car curtain, five flies shot on the vomit like bullets.
"Spit, spit, bump!"
The bearers yelled wildly, "Dian, I'll make her talk sooner or later."
"Big brothers... forgive me..."
The grandmother was in the hiccup, and she said bitterly. After she finished speaking, she burst into tears.
Grandma feels wronged, grandma feels that the future is sinister, and she will never escape the sea of ​​hardship.
Dad, mother, greedy father, cruel mother, you ruined me.
The grandma cried loudly, the sorghum shook in the depths, the bearers were no longer frantic, and the drummers who contributed to the troubles also stopped blowing.
Only grandma's whimper was left, and a weeping little suona entered again, the cry of the suona was more beautiful than all the women's crying.
Grandma stopped crying in the sound of suona, like listening to the sound of heaven, listening to the music that seemed to come from heaven.
The face of the grandmother was withered, and the tears were a little bit more tears. From the sad tune, she heard the sound of death, smelled the breath of death, and saw the crimson lips of death like sorghum and the golden smile of corn.
The bearers were silent and heavy.
The choking of sacrifice in the sedan chair and the accompaniment of the suona at the back of the sedan chair made their hearts tumbling, and the rain beat the soul flags.
People walking on the sorghum path are no longer like welcoming teams, but rather like funeral ceremonies.
The bearer at the feet of grandma, my later grandpa Yu Zhanao, had an unusual premonition in his heart, like a blazing flame, illuminating his future path.
The cry of grandma.
Aroused the love and compassion that was already in his heart.
The bearers took a short break and the sedan chair landed.
Grandma cried so dizzy that she didn't think she had exposed a little foot outside the sedan.
The bearers looked at these exquisite, extremely beautiful little feet, and for a moment they were completely forgotten.
Yu Zhanao came over, bent over, and gently and gently held grandma's little foot, like holding a feathered bird chick, and gently sent it back into the sedan chair.
Grandma was in the sedan chair and was touched by this gentleness. She wanted to lift the sedan chair to see what kind of person this bearer with a warm young man was like.
I think that a thousand-mile marriage is tied by a thread, and the love of a lifetime is a perfect match, and it is the truth without fault.
Yu Zhanao shook my grandma's feet and awakened the great inspiration in his heart to create a new life. From then on, he completely changed his life and also my grandma's life.
The sedan chair started again, and the horn blew a long sound like an ape, and there was no sound.
The wind is blowing, the northeast wind, the clouds are gathering in the sky, blocking the sun, and the sedan chair is even darker.
Grandma heard the wind blew the sorghum, rushing, rushing to the distance.
Grandma heard a rumble of thunder from the northeast.
The bearers quickened their pace.
Grandma didn't know how far the sedan chair was from Shan's house. She was like a tied lamb, and her heart became calmer as she approached her death.
In her chest, grandma holds a pair of sharp scissors. It may be for Shan Bianlang or for herself.
The fact that grandma's sedan chair walked to the toad pit and was robbed occupies a prominent position in my family's legend.
Toad pits are the big depressions in the big depressions. The soil is especially fertile, the water is especially abundant, and the sorghum is especially dense.
Grandma's sedan chair walked here, and the northeast sky was trembling with a blood-red lightning, and a mutilated apricot-yellow sunlight, from the thick clouds, screamed towards the road.
The bearers were out of breath and sweating.
Walking into the toad pit, the air was heavy, the sorghum black on the side of the road was shiny and deep, and the weeds and flowers on the road were almost dead.
There are so many cornflowers, among the weeds, with long slender stems, blooming with purple, blue, pink and white flowers.
Deep in the sorghum, the toad's cry is sad, the grasshopper's chir is desolate, and the fox's wailing is long.
Grandma was in the sedan chair, and suddenly felt a burst of cold, and a thin layer of goose bumps bulged on her skin.
Grandma didn't understand what was going on, she heard someone yelling in front of the sedan:
"Leave the money to buy the road!"
Grandma squatted in her heart, I don't know the sorrows and joys, God, I ran into someone who ate crumbs!
Bandits in Northeast Gaomi are like hairs. They haunt the sorghum fields like fishes. They form gangs, pull gangs, pull mules and kidnap tickets, do all bad things, and never do good things.
If you are hungry, grab two people, buckle one, and release one, and let the person who was released return to the village to report a letter. How many flatbreads with a thickness of two slabs wrapped in eggs and a handful of green onions will be sent.
When eating a flatbread, you need to hold it with your hands and put it in your mouth, so it is called "bun".
"Leave the money to buy the road!"
The man who ate the cake yelled.
The bearers stopped, staring blankly at the passer-by who was cheating across the road.
The man was not tall, his face was painted with black ink, he was wearing a hat made of sorghum strips, and he was wearing a large scorpion clothing. The clothing was open, revealing the tightly buttoned black clothing and the wide belt tied around his waist.
A bulging thing wrapped in red silk cloth was pinned to his waist.
The man pressed the cloth bag with one hand.
After a second thought, grandma felt that nothing was scary anymore. She was not afraid of death. What else was she afraid of?
She raised the car curtain and looked at the man who ate the cake.
The man shouted again: "Leave the money to buy the road!
Or I will break you! "
He patted the guy wrapped in red cloth on his waist.
The drummers took out a string of copper coins rewarded by their great-grandfather from their waists and threw them at the man's feet.
The bearer put down the sedan chair, and also took out the new copper coin and threw it down.
The man kicked the money skewer into a pile, staring at my grandma sitting in the sedan chair.
"You guys, roll me behind the sedan chair, or I will shoot!"
He slapped the guy pinned in his waist and shouted.
The bearers walked slowly to the back of the sedan chair.
Yu Zhanao walked at the end, he turned around abruptly, his eyes were close to the person who ate the cake.
The man changed his color in an instant, his hands tightly covered the red cloth bag in his waist, and screamed: "Don't look back, I will kill you when I look back!"
The Jie passer pressed the guy in his waist, rubbing his feet in front of the sedan chair and squeezing grandma's feet.
Grandma smiled brightly, and the man's hand retracted tightly as if it were hot.
"Get off the sedan chair and follow me!"
He says.
Grandma sat still, her smile on her face solidified.
"Get off the sedan chair!"
Grandma leaned up, stepped over the sedan pole generously, and stood among the colorful cornflowers.
Grandma looked at the person eating the cake with her right eye, and looked at the bearer and drummer with her left eye.
"Go into the sorghum field!"
The robber said while pressing the red cloth around his waist.
Grandma stood comfortably, the lightning in the cloud buzzed with a copper tone, and the dazzling smile on her face was split into countless intermittent fragments.
The passer-by urged grandma to walk into the sorghum field, his hand was always pressed against the guy in his waist.
Grandma looked at Yu Zhanao with excited eyes.
Yu Zhanao walked straight towards the Jie Lu Ren, his thin lips stretched into a firm straight line, the corners of his two mouths were upturned and the other drooped.
"stop!"
The robber shouted feebly, "I will shoot one more step!"
He put his hand on the guy whose waist was wrapped in red cloth.
Yu Zhanao calmly walked towards the squash eater, he took a step forward, and the squash eater shrank a little.
Green sparks jumped from the eyes of the person who ate the cake, and rows of white beads of clear sweat flowed out of his face in astonishment.
When Yu Zhanao was three steps away from him, he screamed in shame, turned and ran.
Yu Zhanaofei moved forward, aimed at his ass, and kicked lightly.
The robber's body was against the tips of the weeds, rubbed against the cornflower flowers, and flew out in parallel, his hands and feet scratched like innocent babies in the low air, and finally fell into the sorghum tree.
"Man, spare your life!
There is an 80-year-old mother in the little people's family, who had to eat this bowl of rice. "
The robber shouted skillfully under Yu Zhanao.
Yu Zhanao grabbed him by the nape of his neck, lifted him up to the sedan chair, threw him hard on the road, and kicked him in his noisy mouth.
The Jie passer screamed, half vomited out, half swallowed into his belly, and blood flowed out of his nose.
Yu Zhanao bent over, pulled out the guy from the robber's waist, and shook off the red cloth, revealing a crooked little tree bump, and everyone sighed.
The man knelt on the ground, begging for mercy repeatedly.
Yu Zhan'ao said: "Robbers say that there is an 80-year-old mother in the family."
He stepped aside and looked at the bearer and drummer, like the leader of a dog group watching the group of dogs.
The bearers and drummers shouted, rushed up, formed a circle, aimed at the robbers, and displayed their fists and legs.
At first, I could still hear the sharp cry of the robbers, but I couldn't hear them for a while.
Grandma stood on the side of the road, listening to the dull sound of smashing the flesh, she glanced at Yu Zhan'ao, then looked up at the lightning in the sky, the solidification on her face was still the kind of dazzling, golden noble Brilliant smile.
A drummer waved a big horn and slammed it in the heart of the road robber. The round blade of the horn smashed into the skull, and it took a lot of effort to pull it out.
There was a grunt in the Jie's stomach, his spasm stretched out, and he lay softly on the ground.
A line of red and white liquid slowly squeezed out from the deep crack.
"died?"
Said the drummer with the deflated trumpet in his hand.
"It's killed, this thing, you can't help but beat it!"
The bearers and the drummers all looked bleak and panicked.
Yu Zhanao looked at the dead and the living, without saying a word.
He tore off a handful of leaves from the sorghum, wiped off the dirt that grandma vomited in the sedan chair, and lifted up the tree lump to take a look, twisted the red cloth around the tree lump a few times, and threw it out. The tree was flying. The lump took the lead, and the red envelope cloth fell behind, like a big red butterfly, falling on the green sorghum.
Yu Zhanao helped her grandma onto the sedan chair and said, "It's raining, hurry up!"
Grandma tore off the sedan curtain and stuffed it into the corner of the sedan chair. She breathed the free air and looked at Yu Zhanao's wide shoulders and thin waist.
He is so close to the sedan chair, grandma can kick his strong blue and white scalp with just one foot.
The sorghum moved forward and backward, and moved in waves. The sorghum on the side of the road stretched its head into the road, bending over to pay respect to my grandma.
The bearers are flying horses and shooting stars, and the bearers are surprisingly stable, like small boats sliding fast on the top of a wave.
The frogs screamed excitedly, welcoming the torrential rain of the coming summer.
The drooping sky, gloomily staring at the silver-gray face of sorghum, blood-red lightning bursts on the sorghum head, thunder was strong, shaking the eardrums.
Grandma was excited in her heart and watched fearlessly at the green waves raised by the black wind. The sound of the clouds whirled around like a whirl, the wind was changing, the sorghum was swaying on all sides, and the fields were in a mess.
The first batch of fierce rains made the sorghum tremble, and the weeds shook. After the fine soil on the road condensed into a mass, it immediately cracked, causing the roof of the sedan chair to snap.
The rain hit grandma's embroidered shoes, hit Yu Zhanao's head, and slanted into grandma's face.
Yu Zhanao and the others sprinted like rabbits, but they still could not escape the thunderstorm in the early afternoon.
The rain knocked down countless sorghums, the rain reveled in the fields, the toads hid under the sorghum roots, and hada hada shaking the snow-white skin under their jaws; the fox squatted in the dark hole, watching the tiny water splashing from the sorghum Zhu, the road soon became muddy, the weeds fell to the ground, and the cornflower soberly held its wet head.
The fat black trousers of the bearers clung to the meat, and people became slim and smooth.
Yu Zhanao's scalp was washed clean and bright, like a full moon in the eyes of grandma.
The rain wet grandma's clothes. She could have hung the car curtain to block the rain. She didn't hang it. She didn't want to hang it. Grandma saw the chaotic and restless world through the open car door.
