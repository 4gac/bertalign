However, the Qin family was puzzled because he heard Baoyu's name calling him in his dream, and it was difficult to ask carefully.
At that time, Baoyu was confused and confused, if he had lost, he got up and took off his clothes.
When Xiren came to tie his trousers, he just stretched out his hand to his thigh, only to feel a piece of cold and sticky wetness, he hurriedly dropped his hand back and asked, "What's the matter?"
Baoyu blushed and twisted his hand.
Xiren was originally a smart woman, two years older than Baoyu, and she has been saving personnel recently.
Seeing Baoyu's situation today, I felt half of it in my heart, and my face turned red with shame, so I couldn't ask any more.
Still tidy up the clothes, then came to Jia's mother, had dinner indiscriminately, and came over here, taking out another middle coat and Baoyu when the maidservants were not around.
Baoyu shyly said, "Good sister, don't tell anyone."
Xiren also asked with a shy smile: "Why are you—"
Having said this, I looked around again, and then asked, "Where did that flow out?"
Baoyu blushed without speaking, but Xiren only looked at him and smiled.
After a while, Baoyu elaborated and listened to the story in his dream.
Speaking of Yunyu's personal affair, Xiren shyly hid his face and laughed.
Baoyu also said that he was so happy that he was so soft and charming, so he forced him to lead what the police phantom had taught him. Xiren knew that Jia’s mother had given him to Baoyu, but there was nothing to evade. After a long time, he had no choice but to make peace. Baoyu kept warm.
Since then, Baoyu has seen Xiren more differently, and Xiren has treated Baoyu more and more conscientiously.
I won't mention this for now.
Let’s say that the Rong Mansion is cost-effective. From top to bottom, there are more than 300 people, and there are one or twenty things a day. It is like a mess, and there is no clue to make a program.
Zheng Si started from that incident and that one person wrote Fang Miao, but suddenly from thousands of miles away, the mustard beans are tiny, a small family, because it has a little ties with the Rongfu, this day is coming to the Rongfu, so Speaking of this one, it's still a clue.
It turned out that this little family, surnamed Wang, is a local family. His ancestors also served as a little Jingguan. In the past, he had known sister Feng's ancestor, the father of Mrs. Wang.
Because of the snobbery of the king's family, he joined the clan and regarded him as a nephew.
At that time, only Mrs. Wang's eldest brother, Sister Feng's father and Mrs. Wang, who were in Beijing, knew that there was such a distant clan, and the rest did not know.
At present, his ancestor has passed away long ago, but he has only one son named Wang Cheng. Due to the depression of his family business, he still moved out of the city to live in the countryside.
Wang Cheng also died one after another, with a son named Gou'er, married Liu's, and gave birth to a son named Ban'er; and gave birth to another daughter, named Huan'er:
A family of four work in agriculture.
Because the dog is making some livelihoods by himself during the day, the Liu family is also involved in other things such as Jingjiu. The two Qingban brothers are left unattended, and the dog takes the mother-in-law Liu Lao Lao and lives alone.
This Lao Lao Liu is an old widow who has survived for generations. She has no money under her knees and lives on only two acres of thin fields.
Now that the son-in-law has taken over the support, wouldn't he be willing, so he made a single-minded effort to help the daughter-in-law live.
Because of the end of the fall and the beginning of winter this year, the weather will come up, and the winter at home has not been done. The dog is irritable. After eating a few glasses of boring wine, Liu does not dare to resist.
Therefore, Lao Liu couldn't read it, so he persuaded: "Uncle, don't sneer at me: Our village people, which one is not honest, guards how big a bowl is and eats how big a meal!
You are all used to eating and drinking because of the blessings of Lao Ziniang when you were young. Now that you have money, you don’t care about your head and your tail. If you don’t have money, you get angry and become a man!
Although we live away from the city, we are at the feet of the emperor.
Money is everywhere in this ‘Chang’an’ city, but it’s a pity that no one will take it.
It's no use jumping at home! "
The dog heard: "You always just sit on the kang's head and talk, can you tell me to rob?"
Lao Liu said, "Who told you to rob?
Everyone should think of a way.
Otherwise, the money will go to our house by itself? "
The dog sneered and said: "If you have a way, you can wait until this time!
I have no relatives who collect taxes or friends who are officials. What can I think of?
Yes, I'm afraid they may not come to care about us. "
Lao Liu said, "That's not true either.
‘It’s up to people to make things happen, and things happen in heaven.’ We have made it. With the blessing of the Bodhisattva, there are some opportunities that we don’t know.
I will think of an opportunity for you.
On that day, you were connected with the Jinling King's family.
Twenty years ago, they believed that you were okay, but now it's you who are making hard shit, and you are estranged from him if you refuse to go.
I think my daughter and I went there once. The second young lady in his family is really happy to treat people, but she is not a big one. Now she is the wife of the second master in Rongguo Mansion.
I heard them say that now that they are getting older, they are more compassionate and compassionate to the poor and old, and they love fasting monks to give.
Although the palace has been promoted now, I'm afraid that the second aunt and wife will recognize us, why don't you walk around?
Or he is still nostalgic, and some benefits are unknown.
As long as he is kind enough to pull out his hair, he will be stronger than our waist! "
Liu's interface said: "You always say so well, how can you be so good at his door?
I'm afraid that his master would not go in and tell him, he didn't just hit his mouth for nothing! "
Who knows that Gou'erli has a strong reputation. Hearing this, he felt a little activity in his heart. Hearing what his wife said, he smiled and said, "The old man said that, besides, you saw this lady once again that day, why not you The old man will go for a walk tomorrow, try the limelight first?"
Old Liu said: "Ouch!
But I said: ‘Hou Men is like a sea. ’
What am I!
His family didn't recognize me, so they ran for nothing. "
The dog said: "Why, I will teach you a way.
You actually brought Xiaoban'er to find the companionship Uncle Zhou. It would be interesting to see him.
This week, the uncle had something to do with my father. We are wonderful. "
Old Liu said, "I know too.
It's just that he doesn't move around many times, knowing how he is now?
This is incredible!
You are a man again, with such a face, naturally you can't go.
Our girl's young daughter-in-law is also hard to sell, but she still leaves my old face to touch her.
Sure enough, it is good, and everyone is good. "
The plan for the night was decided.
The next day, Lao Liu got up to freshen up, and taught Ban'er a few more words; a five- or six-year-old child, heard taking him into the city, and loved him.
So Lao Liu took the board and went into the city to Ningrong Street.
Next to the stone lion in front of the Rongfu gate, I saw a sedan chair full of horses at the door.
Old Lao Liu didn't dare to go there, dusted his clothes, and taught the board a few more words, then slipped to the corner door, and saw a few people sitting on the door with tall chests and gesticulations, talking about things.
Lao Lao Liu had to come up and ask: "My grandfathers are satisfied."
Everyone looked at it for a while, then asked: "Where did it come from?"
Old Lao Liu laughed and said, "I'm looking for my wife's accompany with Uncle Zhou.
Bother that grandfather invite him out for me. "
Those people listened to him and ignored him. For a long time, Fang said, "You are waiting at the corner of the wall far away. Someone from their house will come out soon."
There was an old man in it and said: "Why have you bother with him?"
Yin Xiang said to Liu Lao: "Uncle Zhou went to the south.
He lives in the back area, and their grandmother is at home.
Just hit here and go around the back street door to find it. "
Lao Liu thanked him, and led the board around to the back door. There were some business burdens resting on the door, some selling food and some playing games, and there were thirty or twenty children making a noise.
Lao Liu stopped one and said, "I asked my brother: Is there an Aunt Zhou at home?"
The child rolled his eyes and said, "That Aunt Zhou?
How many Aunt Zhou have here, I don't know which one is in the business? "
Old Liu said, "He is the wife's companion room."
The child said: "This is easy, you followed me."
Leading Mr. Liu into the backyard, he went to a courtyard wall and pointed out: "This is his house."
Then he shouted: "Aunt Zhou, there is a grandmother looking for you."
Zhou Rui's family hurriedly greeted him and asked, "Who is it?"
Old Lao Liu greeted him with a smile and asked, "Okay?
Sister Zhou. "
After Zhou Rui’s family recognized him for a long time, Fang smiled and said, "Lao Liu, how are you?
What do you say, I have not seen you in the past few years, I forgot.
Please sit at home. "
As he walked, Lao Liu smiled and said, "You are always'the nobles forget things too much', do you remember us there?"
With that said, coming to the room, the little girl hired by Zhou Rui's family poured tea and ate.
Zhou Rui's family asked again: "Has Ban'er grown so big!"
After asking some more gossips, I asked Lao Lao Liu:
"Is it still passing by today, or is it here?"
Lao Liu said, "I came here to see my sister-in-law. Secondly, I also ask my aunt to please her.
If you can show me a better view, if not, just ask my sister-in-law to pass on my compliments. "
When Zhou Rui's family heard this, he had already guessed what he was coming from.
It was only because of his husband’s fight to buy the land in the past that his father could do much better. Seeing Mr. Liu like this now, I feel uncomfortable.
Second, we must show our dignity.
He smiled and said, "Don't worry about the old man.
Da Yuan’s sincerity has come, is there anyone who doesn’t ask you to see a true Buddha?
Arguably, people come and visit, but they are not related to me.
We are all the same here:
Our men only take care of the land rent in the spring and autumn seasons, and when we are free, we will take our little men out and we will be finished;
I just go out with my wife and grandma.
It's all because you are a relative of your wife, and you took me as a person and went to me. I made an exception to send you a letter.
But there is only one thing, you don’t know yet: we are no better here than five years ago.
Now the wife is ignoring the matter, and she is all headed by Mrs. Lian.
Who are you looking for?
It's the wife's niece, the girl of the uncle's master, whose nickname is Brother Feng. "
Old Liu said: "Amitabha!
This is all convenient for my sister-in-law. "
Zhou Rui's family said: "The old man said there.
The saying goes well: ‘It’s convenient for others, it’s convenient for yourself. ’
But with a word of mine, it doesn't cost me anything. "
After speaking, she called the little girl to the down hall and quietly inquired whether the old lady had food in her room.
The little girl went.
Here the two talked more gossip.
Liu Laoyin said: "This Phoenix girl is only eighteen or nineteen years old this year. She has the ability to be a home like this, but it's rare!"
Zhou Rui's family listened and said, "Hey!
My old man, I can't tell you!
Although this girl Feng is young, she is older than a human being.
Nowadays, it is like a beauty who is overwhelming, and I am afraid that I will have ten thousand minds.
If you have to gamble, ten men who know how to talk can't talk about him!
You will know when you come back.
It's just one piece, and it's too strict for the next person. "
With that, the little girl turned back and said, "The old lady's room is finished, and the mistress is in the wife's room."
After hearing this, Zhou Rui’s family hurriedly got up and urged Lao Lao Liu: "Hurry up, now it’s just empty for dinner, let’s wait to go first.
If it is a step late, there will be more people going on, and it will be hard to tell.
After taking a rest, the time is getting worse. "
With that, he got down the kang, straightened his clothes, and taught Ban'er a few more words, and followed Zhou Rui's family to Jia Lian's house.
First came to the hall, Zhou Rui’s family plugged in Liu Lao Lao’an and waited, but he passed the screen wall first and walked into the courtyard. Knowing that Sister Feng had not yet come out, she first looked for one of Feng’s confidant’s big girls named Ping’er; Zhou Rui’s family He first explained the origins of Liu Lao Lao at the beginning, and said: "Today, please come to see you from Dayuan. My wife is a regular meeting, so I brought him over.
Waiting for my grandma to come down, I clarified meticulously, and I didn't want to come to grandma to anger me recklessly. "
Ping'er heard this and made an idea: "Send them in and just sit here first."
Zhou Rui's family went out and led them in.
On the steps of the main house, the little girl put on the scarlet felt curtain before entering the main room. She only smelled the scent and puffed on her face. She didn't know what the smell was, her body was like being in the clouds.
Everything in the room was dazzling and dazzling, making people dizzy. At this time, Old Old Lao Liu just nodded and chanted to Buddha.
So I went to this room to the east, where Jia Lian's daughter slept.
Ping'er stood by the edge of the kang, looked at Liu Lao Lao's eyes, and had to say hello and let her sit down.
Seeing Ping'er all over Lingluo, inserting gold and silver, with a beautiful face and a beautiful appearance, he should be called "granny aunt" when he was Feng Sister. Only Zhou Rui's family said: "He is Ping girl."
Seeing Ping'er rushing to Zhou Rui's house and calling him "Aunt Zhou", she knew she was just a decent girl.
So Lao Liu and Ban'er went to the kang, and Ping'er and Zhou Rui's opposite side sat on the kang, and the little girls poured tea and ate them.
Old Lao Liu could only hear the rattling noise, which was very similar to that of sieve noodles. I could not help but look from the east to the west. Suddenly I saw a box hanging on the pillar in the hall, and there was a weighing scale underneath it. Live in a mess.
Old Lao Liu thought to himself: "What is this?
Is it useful? "
When I was in a daze, the sound of a "dang" sound was like a golden bell, and I couldn't help but open my eyes.
Then there were eight or nine times in a row. When I was about to ask questions, I saw the little girls running around and saying, "Grandma is down."
Ping'er and Zhou Rui's family hurriedly got up and said, "Old and old, just sit down. We will invite you when it's time."
Said to welcome out.
Lao Lao Liu listened silently and listened to the laughter from a distance. About ten or twenty women, with rusty dresses, gradually entered the hall and went into the other house.
I saw three or two women, all holding red paint boxes coming here to wait.
Hearing over there said "preparing food", and gradually the people scattered, only a few people who were waiting for the food.
For a long time, I didn't smell it.
Suddenly they saw two people lift a kang table and put it on this kang. The bowls and dishes on the table were still full of fish, but it moved slightly.
As soon as Ban'er saw him, he clamored for meat, and Liu Lao slapped him.
Suddenly I saw Zhou Rui's smile coming over and called him.
Lao Liu understood, so he took the board and went down to the kang, to the middle of the hall, Zhou Rui's family grunted with him for a while, and then he rubbed into the room.
I saw a big red sprinkling curtain hanging on the copper hook outside the door, a kang under the south window, and a big red strip of felt on the kang. On the east side wall, there is a backrest and a pillow, covered with golden thread. Sitting on a mattress, there is a silver saliva box beside it.
Sister Feng often wears a sable Zhaojun suit, surrounds the Zhuanzhulezi, wears a pink sprinkle jacket, a stone green squirrel cloak, and a red crepe silver rat leather skirt;
She was bright and bright, sitting there upright, holding a small copper fire chopstick in her hand and touching the ashes in the hand furnace.
Ping'er stood on the edge of the kang, holding a small lacquer-filled tea tray with a small lid clock inside.
Sister Feng didn't pick up the tea, nor did she look up, she just brushed the ash, and slowly said, "Why haven't you invited in yet?"
On the one hand, when he raised himself to ask for tea, he saw that Zhou Rui's family had already brought two people to stand in front of him. Then he was eager to get up, but still did not get up, greeted Zhou Rui's spring breezely. "
Old Lao Liu had already worshipped a few times underground, and asked his aunt and grandma.
Sister Feng said hurriedly: "Sister Zhou, don't worship.
I'm young and don't recognize it, but I don't know what generation it is, so I dare not call it. "
Zhou Rui's family hurriedly replied: "This is the old one I just returned."
Sister Feng nodded, and Lao Liu had already sat down on the edge of the kang.
Ban'er hid behind him and coaxed him out in every possible way, but he refused to die.
Sister Feng smiled and said, "The relatives don't move much, they are all estranged.
Those who know, say that you abandon us and refuse to come often; the villain who doesn't know seems to be no one in our eyes. "
Lao Liu was busy reciting the Buddhist Tao: "Our family is difficult and can't afford to walk.
When I came here, I didn't slap my aunt, even the housekeepers looked at me. "
Sister Feng smiled and said, "This is nothing disgusting.
But I trust my grandfather to be a poor official. Whose family has anything?
But it's also an empty air. As the saying goes, ‘the court still has three sons and poor relatives’, let alone you and me. "
Then he asked Zhou Rui's family: "Have you returned to your wife?"
Zhou Rui's said: "Wait for grandma's show."
Sister Feng said: "Go and see, if there are people; if you want to be free, just go back, see how you say it."
Zhou Rui's family agreed to go.
Here, Sister Feng asked someone to grab some fruits for Ban'er to eat. When she first asked a few gossips, there were many daughter-in-laws who were in charge of the family back and forth.
Ping'er returned, and Sister Feng said: "I'm here to accompany guests, and I will come back and forth at night.
If there is something urgent, you can bring it in and do it now. "
Ping'er went out and came in for a while and said, "I asked, it doesn't matter.
I told them to leave. "
Sister Feng nodded.
When Zhou Rui came back, she said to Sister Feng: "The wife said: ‘I don’t have time today. The same is true with my mistress. Thank you for bothering thinking about it.
If you come here for nothing, just tell the mistress if you have anything to say. ’"
Old Liu said, "I didn't say much, but I came to see my aunts, aunts, and grandmothers. It is also the affection of relatives."
Zhou Rui's said: "If there is nothing to say;
If you have something to say, just go back to the mistress, the same as your wife. "
He said and gave a wink.
Lao Liu knew, blushed before saying a word.
Wait or say, why are you here today?
I had to say reluctantly: "On the first time I saw you today, what I shouldn't have said is that I just rushed to your old place, so I can't say it..."
Having just said this, I only heard the servants on the second door replied: "The little uncle in the East Mansion has come in."
Sister Feng hurriedly waved to Lao Liu, "No need to say."
He asked, "Where is your Uncle Rong?"
Just listening to the sound of boots all the way, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy came in, with a handsome face, a slender figure, a beautiful dress with a crown, and a light fur belt.
Lao Lao Liu is sitting right now, not standing, nowhere to hide, nowhere to hide.
Sister Feng smiled and said, "Just sit down, this is my nephew."
Lao Lao Liu sat down on the edge of the kang, twistingly.
Jia Rong invited Ann, and smiled back and said, "My father sent me to beg my aunt. Last time, the glass kang screen that the old uncle and wife gave to my aunt, tomorrow, I will invite an important guest and send it to you."
Sister Feng said: "You are late, and it was given to someone yesterday."
When Jia Rong heard that, she knelt down and down on the edge of the kang grinning and said, "Auntie, if you don't want to borrow, my father said that I can't speak anymore, and I will have to get a good fight.
Good aunt, just pity me! "
Sister Feng smiled and said, "I haven't seen that everything in our Wang family is good?
You have those good things in there. Don't just see my things. When you see them, you want to take them. "
Jia Rong smiled and said: "Just begging my aunt for good!"
Sister Feng said: "Break a little bit, you can take care of your skin!"
Because Ming Ping'er took the key from the building door and called some proper people to carry it.
Jia Rongxi smiled openly, and said hurriedly: "I will take them personally, don't ask them to touch them."
Then he got up and went out.
This Sister Feng suddenly remembered something, and called out the window: "Rong'er come back!"
Several people outside answered, "Please come back, Uncle Rong!"
Jia Rong came back hurriedly, looking at Sister Feng with a smile on her face, listening to any instructions.
Sister Feng just ate tea slowly. After a long time, she suddenly blushed and smiled: "No, you go first.
Come and talk after dinner.
There are people in this meeting, and I am out of energy. "
Jia Rong agreed, pursed her lips and smiled before Fang slowly withdrew.
Lao Liu settled down and said:
"I brought your nephew today, not for anything else, because his parents didn't even have food, and the weather was cold, so I had to take your nephew and run away with you."
After speaking, he pushed the board and said: "How did your father teach you at home?
Send us to do evil things?
Just eat fruit! "
Sister Feng had already understood it, and she couldn't speak to him, because she smiled and said, "No need to say, I know."
Because he asked Zhou Rui's family: "Is this old man not sure if he has used breakfast?"
Lao Liu hurriedly said, "I'll go here early in the morning. Is there still time to eat there?"
Sister Feng ordered to deliver food soon.
For a while, Zhou Rui’s family passed a table of delicacies, placed in the East Room, and brought Lao Lao Liu and Ban'er over for dinner.
Sister Feng said here: "Sister Zhou is so good, I can't accompany her."
On the other hand, the person who called Zhou Rui's family came and asked: "I just returned to his wife, what did the wife say?"
Zhou Rui’s family said: "The wife said: ‘They were not a family; back then, their ancestors and the grandfather were officials at the same place, because they were in a relationship.
I haven't moved much in recent years.
When they came, they never had time.
It's his kindness to come to see us now, don't slow him down.
If you have anything, just ask the mistress to cut it off. ’"
Sister Feng heard this and said, "Since Weird Dao is a family, I don't even know Yinger!"
While talking, Lao Liu had finished his meal, pulled the board over, and licked his lips to thank him.
Sister Feng smiled and said: "Please sit down and listen to me telling you: I already know what you meant just now.
As far as relatives are concerned, they should have taken care of them without waiting for the door; but now there are too many things in the family, and the wife is getting older, and it was unexpected for a while.
I continue to take care of things now, but these relatives don't know much about it, and even though it looks fiercely outside, I don't know that there are great difficulties, and I may not believe it.
You came so far, and you opened your mouth to me for the first time. How do you make you go back empty?
But by coincidence, the twenty taels of silver that my wife gave to my girls yesterday hasn't moved yet. You don't think it is too little, so take it and use it first. "
Then Lao Lao Liu heard the hardship first, just as he hadn't thought about it, and then heard that he was given twenty taels of silver, and he smiled with joy: "We also know the hardship, but only the saying goes:'A thin camel is better than a horse. It's still big.
Whatever he is, you always pull out a shabby hair that is stronger than our waist. "
Zhou Rui's family was in the audience and heard what he said vulgarly, so he just gave him a wink.
Sister Feng smiled without squinting, and asked Ping'er to bring the bag of silver from yesterday and a bunch of money to Liu Lao.
Sister Feng said, "This is twenty taels of silver, let's make winter clothes for the children for now.
It's okay another day, just come and stroll, that's what the relatives meant.
It’s too late, it’s worth leaving you, and if you’re home, please say hello. "
On the one hand, he stood up.
Lao Lao Liu was only thankful, took the money, and followed Zhou Rui's family to the outside.
Zhou Rui's said: "My mother!
How come you can't speak when you meet him?
The opening is ‘your nephew’.
Let me say something that is not afraid of your annoyance: even your nephew should be softer.
Then Grandpa Rong is his nephew.
Why did he run out of such a nephew again! "
Old Liu smiled and said, "My sister-in-law!
When I saw him, I still couldn't love the love in my heart, so what could I say there? "
As they said, they went to Zhou Rui's house to sit for a while.
Lao Liu wanted to leave a piece of silver for the children of Zhou's family to buy fruit to eat, but Zhou Rui's family took it seriously and insisted.
Old Lao Liu thanked him endlessly, but went through the back door.
I don't know what to do after going, let's listen to the next decomposition.
