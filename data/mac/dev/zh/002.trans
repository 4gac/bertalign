The sound of boots reached the door and the man walked in.
Wei Xiaobao looked out from under the table and saw that the boots were not big, and the visitor should be a boy about his age. He immediately felt relieved and put the sesame seed in his mouth, but he did not dare to chew it. He just soaked the sesame seed with his saliva and let it soften. Swallowed.
Only the sound of chewing came from the table. The boy was taking cakes and eating. Wei Xiaobao thought: "I am also a stealer. I rushed out with a shout. This kid will run away in fright, so I can chew. It's a meal."
Then I thought: "I was so stupid just now, I should pour a few plates of snacks into my bag and leave.
This is not the Lichun Academy, is it short of something, it must be calculated on my head? "
Suddenly, there was a bang, and the boy was knocking something. Wei Xiaobao became curious and looked around. He saw that the boy was about fourteen or five years old, wearing a short punch, and stretching out a cloth bag hanging from a boxing beam.
He hit for a while, then went to hit the leather man by the wall.
The boy hit the leather man’s chest with a punch, then stretched out his arms, hugged the leather man’s waist, and pressed it to the ground. The way he did it was just like the people who wrestled in the tavern yesterday. .
Wei Xiaobao laughed, got out from the bottom of the table, and said, "The skin man is dead, what's so fun?"
I will play with you. "
The boy was slightly surprised when he saw him suddenly appear, with a white cloth wrapped around his face, but when he heard that he was going to play with him, his face instantly became happy and said, "Okay, you come up!"
Wei Xiaobao rushed over and twisted the boy's arms.
The boy turned on his side and hooked his right hand. Wei Xiaobao could not stand and fell immediately.
The boy said: "Bah, you don't know how to fall."
Wei Xiaobao said: "Who said no?"
Jumped up and went to hug his left leg.
The boy reached out and grabbed his back. Wei Xiaobao flashed, and the boy grabbed nothing.
Wei Xiaobao remembered Mao Shiba's fighting with seven big guys in the tavern. He suddenly punched his left hand and hit the boy's jaw with a bang, just in time.
The boy was startled, an angry expression appeared in his eyes.
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "Bah, you can't fall in love!"
The boy didn't say a word, his left hand flickered, Wei Xiaobao leaned to avoid him, the boy elbows out and hit his waist.
Wei Xiaobao yelled, squatting down in pain.
The boy put his hands under his armpit behind his back, held his fingers together, clasped the back of his neck, and pressed his upper body lower and lower.
Wei Xiaobao kicked with right foot.
The boy slammed Wei Xiaobao out with both hands, and fell into a dog to eat shit with a pat.
Wei Xiaobao was furious, rolled over, hugged the boy's legs hard, and dragged hard. The boy couldn't stand and fell down, just pressing on Wei Xiaobao.
The boy was taller than Wei Xiaobao, and immediately forced Wei Xiaobao's neck with his elbow.
Wei Xiaobao couldn't breathe well. He stretched out his feet desperately and turned a few times before finally reaching the top and pressing back on the boy.
I saw that the other's body couldn't hold the opponent lightly, and the boy turned it up to hold it down.
Wei Xiaobao was extremely slippery, let go of the boy's legs, got behind him, and kicked his ass vigorously.
The boy grabbed his right leg with his backhand and tugged, and Wei Xiaobao fell on his back.
The boy jumped up and crossed his neck and shouted, "Do you not surrender?"
Wei Xiaobao hooked his left foot and wiped the boy's waist a few times. The boy was ticklish and smiled and his hand was loose.
Wei Xiaobao took the opportunity to jump up and hugged his head and neck.
The boy used a wrestling technique and grabbed Wei Xiaobao's back collar and threw him heavily to the ground.
Wei Xiaobao was dizzy and could not move.
The boy laughed and said, "Have you taken it?"
Wei Xiaobao jumped up abruptly, hitting the opponent's abdomen with a head hammer.
The boy snorted and took a few steps back.
Wei Xiaobao rushed forward, the boy leaning slightly, swept across his feet.
Wei Xiaobao fell and hugged his thigh.
Both fell at the same time.
Suddenly the boy turned on top, and then Wei Xiaobao turned on top. After seventeen or eight rolls, the two finally twisted each other and gasped for breath. Suddenly, the two of them laughed and laughed in unison. Both felt that such a fight was very fun. , Slowly let go of his hand.
As soon as the boy stretched out his hand, he pulled away the white cloth on Wei Xiaobao's face and said with a smile: "What are you doing with your head covered?"
Wei Xiaobao was taken aback and wanted to stretch out his hand to grab it, but thought that since the other party had seen his true face, it would be useless to cover it up. He smiled and said, "You wrap your face so that you won't be recognized when you come in and steal food."
The boy stood up and said with a smile: "Okay, so you go here to steal food from time to time."
Wei Xiaobao said: "It doesn't always happen."
He stood up as he spoke, and saw that the boy was pretty and handsome, and had a good impression of him.
The boy asked, "What's your name?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "My name is Xiao Guizi, how about you?"
The boy hesitated for a moment and said, "My name is... Xiao Xuanzi.
Which father-in-law are you under? "
Wei Xiaobao said, "My husband Hai."
Xiao Xuanzi nodded, wiped the sweat on his forehead with Wei Xiaobao's white cloth, picked up a snack and ate.
Wei Xiaobao refused to admit defeat, thinking that you were bold enough to steal food, and I was no less courageous than you, so he immediately picked up a piece of mullet cake and put it in his mouth unscrupulously.
Xiao Xuanzi smiled and said, "You have never learned wrestling, but your hands and feet are very flexible. I can't help you. If you fight for a few more rounds, you will lose."
Wei Xiaobao said, "That's not necessarily true. Let's try it a little while."
Xiao Xuanzi said: "Very good!"
The two struggled again.
Xiao Xuanzi seems to have some wrestling skills, and he is older and stronger than Wei Xiaobao. However, Wei Xiaobao has experienced many battles in the wells of Yangzhou City, and he has fought many fights with big gangsters and little rascals. The experience of fighting is far better than Xiaoxuanzi is rich.
After all, he remembered Mao Shishi’s lesson, and the scuffle with Xiao Xuanzi was just a game, not desperate. Famous stunts such as twisting fingers, pulling pigtails, biting throat, grasping eyeballs, pulling ears, pinching scrotum, etc. No use.
In this way, it would be difficult to win. After a few rounds of scuffles, Wei Xiaobao finally rode him on his back and could not turn over again.
Xiao Xuanzi smiled and said, "Do you not surrender?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "You will not surrender if you die."
Xiao Xuanzi laughed and jumped up.
Wei Xiaobao rushed forward and wanted to fight again.
Xiao Xuanzi shook his hand and smiled: "I won't fight today, and come back tomorrow.
But you are not my opponent, it's useless to fight. "
Wei Xiaobao was not convinced, and took out a silver coin, about three or two, and said, "I'll fight tomorrow, but if you want to bet money, you also take three and two silver."
Xiao Xuanzi was startled and said, "Okay, let's make a splash.
Tomorrow I will bring my money, and I will fight here again at noon. "
Wei Xiaobao said: "The dead date will never be seen or left. The big man said nothing but... the horse is hard to follow."
He always couldn't remember this "siege" that was "difficult to chase", so he had to pass it vaguely.
Xiao Xuanzi laughed loudly and said, "Yes, the man said nothing but... the horse is hard to follow."
Said and left the house.
Wei Xiaobao grabbed a large amount of dim sum, put it in his arms, and walked out of the house. He remembered that Mao Shiba had a contract to compete with others. Even though he was in prison, he had to escape from prison to attend the appointment. Although he was seriously injured, he still vowed to keep his promise and was under the victory mountain. Waiting for the two masters, this kind of spirit is really admirable.
He heard that Mr. Shu told hero stories, and he heard a lot. He always imagined that he was also a great hero and a great hero. How could he not make a match with others?
I thought that tomorrow I was coming, and I had to return to the sea husband tonight, so I followed the same path and slowly found a place for gambling.
I walked to the right before, so I went farther and farther. This time I turned to the left and walked through two corridors. I vaguely remembered that I had seen the flowers and trees in the garden. I searched all the way to the past, and finally returned to the residence of the sea husband.
When he walked to the door, he heard the coughing of husband Hai and asked: "Father, are you better?"
Husband Hai said in a deep voice: "Good ass!
come on in! "
Wei Xiaobao walked into the house and saw Husband Hai sitting on a chair, and the collapsed table had been changed.
Mrs. Hai asked: "How much did you win?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "I won more than ten taels of silver, but...but..."
Mrs. Hai said: "But what?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "But I lent it to Old Wu."
In fact, he won more than two dozen taels. In addition to lending to Lao Wu, there are eight or nine taels left. For fear that her husband will ask him to hand it over, the report will be inaccurate.
Old man Hai's face sank and said, "What's the use of lending this kid to Old Wu?
He didn't go to the study.
Why don't you lend it to the Wen brothers? "
For unknown reasons, Wei Xiaobao said, "Brother Wen didn't borrow from me."
Mrs. Hai said: "If you didn't borrow it from you, wouldn't you want to lend it to him?
Did I forget what I told you? "
Wei Xiaobao said, "I... I killed this kid last night and I was so scared that I forgot everything.
To lend it to the Wen family, yes, yes, your old man really ordered it. "
Husband Hai snorted and said, "What's so great about killing someone?
But it's no wonder that you are young and haven't killed anyone.
Did you forget that book? "
Wei Xiaobao said: "That book... Book... I... I..."
Husband Hai snorted again and said, "Really forget everything?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Father-in-law, I... I have a headache, I'm afraid... I'm so scared, you're coughing like this again, I'm so worried, what... Everything is foolish."
Mrs. Hai said: "Okay, come here!
"Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes! "
Take a few steps closer.
Mrs. Hai said: "I'll say it again, if you don't remember anymore, I will kill you."
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes, yes."
I thought: "You just have to say it again, and I won't forget it in a hundred years."
Mrs. Hai said: "You go to win the money of the Wen brothers. If they lose, they will lend them. The more you borrow, the better.
After a few days, you will ask them to take you to the study.
They owe you money and don't dare to disobey it. If you push back and forth, you will say that I will follow up with the master of the study, Mr. Wu, to settle the accounts.
If the Wen brothers don’t pay, they will take the emperor away..."
Wei Xiaobao said: "The emperor?"
Mrs. Hai said: "What?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "No... nothing."
Mrs. Hai said: "They will ask you what they are doing in the study, and you will say that people look up high and hope to see the emperor and be able to work in the study.
Brother Wen will not let you see the emperor. When he takes you there, the emperor will not be in the study. You must try to steal a book. "
When Wei Xiaobao heard him mention the emperor one after another, his heart moved: "Is this the palace?
Not the big brothel in Beijing?
Ah yo hello, yes, yes, if it's not a palace, how can there be such a magnificent?
These people must be eunuchs serving the emperor. "
Although Wei Xiaobao had heard people say that the emperor, queen, prince, princess, as well as court ladies and eunuchs, he only knew that the emperor must wear dragon robes.
He has watched a lot of white operas in Yangzhou, but the eunuchs on the stage are completely different from those of the old man and the old man. They always hold a whisk in their hands and wave them around. A nice sentence.
He spent a day with her husband Hai, and bet for a long time with the old Wu and the Wen brothers, but I don’t know that they are eunuchs. Listening to her husband at this moment, he gradually realized that, and said, "Ah, this way, Am I still a little eunuch?"
Husband Hai sternly said: "Do you understand?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes, yes, I understand, I have to go to the emperor... the emperor's study."
Mrs. Hai said, "What are you going to do in the emperor's study?
Go to play? "
Wei Xiaobao said, "I'm going to steal a book."
Mrs. Hai said: "What book to steal?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "This... this... What book... I... I can't remember."
Mrs. Hai said: "I'll say it again, you remember it well.
It is a Buddhist scripture called "Forty-two Chapters". This scripture is quite old. There are several copies in total. You should bring it to me together.
Remember it?
what is it call? "
Wei Xiaobao said with joy: "It's called the "Forty-two Chapters"."
Mrs. Hai heard the joy in his words and asked, "What's the fun?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "When you mention it, I remember it, so I'm happy."
It turned out that he heard from her husband Hai that he wanted him to go to the study to "steal books". "Stealing" is never difficult, but "books" stumped people.
He couldn't read a load of watermelon characters. He had to distinguish between books, but he couldn't do it even if he really killed his head. When he heard that the title of the book was "Forty-two Chapters", he couldn't help but exulted. What is "Zhang Jing" Unknown, the three characters "forty-two" can be recognized, and three of the five characters can be recognized.
The old man Hai said again: "Stealing books in the study room can be clean and tidy. If people see it, you will have a hundred lives."
Wei Xiaobao said: "I care about this. If someone stole something and caught it, is there any good acting?"
With an idea, he said: "But I will never recruit your father-in-law."
The old man Hai sighed, "If you recruit me, it doesn't matter."
After coughing for a while, he said, "You did a good job today, and you actually won money.
Are they suspicious? "
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "Hey, no, how could that happen?"
I wanted to compliment myself, but finally held back.
Mrs. Hai said: "Don't be lazy, just sit around and practice more."
Wei Xiaobao responded and walked into the room. There were tableware and chopsticks on the table, four dishes and one soup. No one had ever moved. He said hurriedly, "Father, you won't eat?
I will pretend to be for you. "
Mrs. Hai said: "Don't be hungry, don't eat, you can eat it yourself."
Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed. He didn't have time to load the rice. He picked up a piece of braised pork and ate it. Although the dishes were already cold and hungry, they were indescribably delicious. He thought, "I don't know who brought these meals.
Don't ask too much about such trivial matters, just keep your eyes open and you will know it slowly. "
Then he thought: "If this is really a palace, then Old Wu, Wen's brother, and the little Xuanzi are all eunuchs.
But I don't know how the emperor Lao'er and the queen empress look like, so you have to understand.
Back to Yangzhou, hehe, I'm pretty airy.
Brother Mao can't escape the palace?
When I was gambling, I didn't hear them talking about holding people, most of them escaped. "
After eating, I was afraid that Mrs. Hai would be suspicious, so I took six dice and threw them endlessly in the bowl for a while, only to feel that the eyelids were getting heavier, and I did not sleep all night last night. At this time, I was really tired. Very much, and soon fell asleep.
He slept until the evening, and then a rough eunuch brought food.
Wei Xiaobao served her husband Hai to eat a bowl of rice, and then served him to bed. He slept in a small bed and thought: "The most important thing tomorrow is to compete with Xiao Xuanzi. It is better to beat him."
I closed my eyes and recalled the way Mao Shiba had fought with the Manchurian warriors in the tavern, but he vaguely remembered it and couldn't help but regret: "Brother Mao wants to teach me martial arts, but I refuse to learn it. Now, even though Xiao Xuanzi is stronger than me, how can he be my opponent?
Tomorrow, if you ride him again and can't turn it over, it doesn't matter if you lose the silver, and you lose face like this. My "little white dragon" Wei Xiaobao won't have to mess around in the arena. "
Suddenly I thought: "The Manchurian warrior can't beat Big Brother Mao, and Brother Mao is not Old Turtle's opponent. Why don't you trick Old Turtle to teach me something?"
Immediately he said: "Father-in-law, you want me to go to the study to get some books, but there is a difficulty in the middle."
Mrs. Hai said: "What's the difficulty?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "I gambled back today and met a little... little eunuch. He blocked the way and asked me to divide the money to him. I refused, so he competed with me, saying that I was better than him. Let me go.
I fought him for a long time, so... So I couldn't even come back to eat. "
Mrs. Hai said, "You lost, didn't you?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "He is tall and strong, and his strength is much greater than mine.
He said he would compete with me every day, and he wouldn't come to pester me when I beat him. "
Mr. Hai said, "What's the name of this little baby?
Which room is it from? "
Wei Xiaobao said, "He is called Xiaoxuanzi, but I don't know which room he belongs to."
Mrs. Hai said: "You must have won the money, and you are so annoying, otherwise others won't find you."
Wei Xiaobao said: "I'm not convinced. I'll fight him again tomorrow, I don't know if I can win."
Husband Hai snorted and said, "You are asking me to teach martial arts again.
I said not to teach, or not to teach, it's useless for you to go around. "
Wei Xiaobao was shocked in his heart: "Old tortoise is clever and not fooled."
Said: "This little xuanzi doesn't know martial arts, I want to beat him, and there is no need to learn martial arts, who wants you to teach?
I was clearly riding on him today, but he was so strong that he turned over.
Tomorrow I will try to lift him, this guy may not be able to turn over. "
He had been careful to converge this day, and did not say a word of vulgarity, then finally couldn't help but say a word.
Mrs. Hai said: "You don't think he can turn it over, that's easy."
Wei Xiaobao said: "I don't think there is any difficulty, I will hold his shoulder firmly tomorrow."
Mrs. Hai said, "Huh, what's the use of lifting your shoulders?
Whether you can turn over or not, depends on the strength of your waist, you have to put your knees against his back waist acupuncture points.
Come here and I will show it to you. "
Wei Xiaobao jumped down from the bed and walked to his bed. Her husband Hai touched a part of his lower back. With a light press, Wei Xiaobao felt sore and weak.
Mrs. Hai said: "Remember?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes, I will try tomorrow, but I don't know if it will work?"
Husband Hai said angrily: "What is it?
That is a hundred shots and a hundred hits. "
He stretched out his hand and pressed lightly on both sides of his neck.
Wei Xiaobao yelled "Ah", only to feel suffocated in his chest and breathless.
Mrs. Hai said: "If you try to use his two acupoints, he won't have the strength to fight you."
Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and said: "It's done, tomorrow I will be able to beat him."
The word "quasi" was learned during gambling during the day.
When I returned to bed and fell asleep, I remembered that tomorrow "Little White Dragon" Wei Xiaobao would beat Xiao Xuanzi and shouted "surrender", very proud.
The next day Old Wu came and told him to gamble.
One of the Wen brothers was called Wen Youdao and the other was called Wen Youfang. When it was the two brothers' turn to be the banker, Wei Xiaobao resorted to means to win them more than 20 taels.
His brothers were so lucky. In less than half an hour, their fifty-two capital had already been lost.
Wei Xiaobao lent them twenty taels, and when the gambling stopped, the Wen brothers lost the twenty taels.
What Wei Xiaobao remembered was just about competing with Xiao Xuanzi, and when the gambling game broke up, he ran to the room.
There were still many dim sums on the table. He took a few pieces and ate. He heard the sound of boots. I was afraid that it was not Xiao Xuanzi who came. He wanted to get under the table before talking, but he heard Xiao Xuanzi outside the door. Shouted: "Little Guizi, Little Guizi!"
Wei Xiaobao leaped to the door and said with a smile: "A dead date, see or leave."
Xiao Xuanzi also smiled and said: "Haha, dead date, see or leave."
Walk into the house.
When Wei Xiaobao saw him in his new clothes, he was very gorgeous, and he couldn't help being quite jealous. He thought: "I will tear your new clothes later and make you feel embarrassed!"
With a loud cry, he rushed towards him.
Xiao Xuanzi shouted: "Good come."
He twisted his arms and swept his left foot.
Wei Xiaobao was unsteady, shaking for a few times, and fell down, pulling Xiao Xuanzi down as well.
Wei Xiaobao rolled around, rolled over and pressed against Xiao Xuanzi's back, remembering what Husband Hai taught, he stretched out his hand to take the acupuncture points on his back, but he has not practiced the skills of punching acupoints.
The part he was holding was slightly off, Xiao Xuanzi had already turned over, grabbed his left arm, and twisted it backward.
Wei Xiaobao exclaimed: "Ah yo, are you shameless, bend your arms?"
Xiao Xuanzi smiled and said: "Learning to wrestle is to learn to stubborn arms, what shame?"
Wei Xiaobao took advantage of his words to levitate, slammed his whole body into his waist, slammed the vest on his head, and put his right hand through his armpit and threw it upward vigorously.
Xiao Xuanzi's body flew over his head and fell to the ground with a clap.
Xiao Xuanzi turned over and jumped up, and said, "So you can also use this trick of'antelope hanging horns'."
Wei Xiaobao didn't know what the "antelope hanging horns" technique was. He won by accidentally hitting and colliding. He was very proud, and said, "What is this "antelope hanging horns". I still have many powerful methods that I haven't used."
Xiao Xuanzi said with joy: "That's nothing better, let's make gestures again."
Wei Xiaobao said in his heart: "So you have learned martial arts, no wonder you can't beat you.
But if you use a trick, I will learn a trick, and at most give you a few more blows, I can always learn your tricks. "
Seeing Xiao Xuanzi rushing forward again, he rushed forward too.
Unexpectedly, Xiao Xuanzi's pounce was fake. When Wei Xiaobao pounced, he had already closed his posture, stepped aside, and stretched out his hand to push on his back.
Wei Xiaobao rushed to the air, already unable to hold his feet, and then pushed him out smoothly. He suddenly banged and fell heavily.
Xiao Xuanzi cheered loudly, jumped over to ride on his back, and cried, "Do you not surrender?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "No drop!"
I wanted to stand up, and there was a sudden tingling around my waist. Two acupuncture points on the lower back were blocked by Xiao Xuanzi's fingers. That was exactly the technique that husband Hai taught last night. Although I learned it, I gave him the first use. Out.
Wei Xiaobao struggled to get rid of a few times, so he had to shout, "Okay, I will drop you once!"
Xiao Xuanzi laughed and let him stand up.
Wei Xiaobao suddenly stretched his feet and tripped. Xiao Xuanzi leaned forward and wanted to fall. Wei Xiaobao shot a fist and hit his waist.
Xiao Xuanzi snorted in pain and bent down, and Wei Xiaobao leaped back, holding both sides of his head and neck with both hands.
Xiao Xuanzi was dizzy and fell to the ground.
Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed, holding hands tightly, and asked, "Do you not surrender?"
Xiao Xuanzi snorted, and suddenly his ribs slammed back.
Wei Xiaobao's ribs in his chest were so painful that he was about to break, shouted, and fell to the sky.
Xiao Xuanzi turned over and sat on his chest. He won again this round. He was panting, and was too exhausted to catch his breath. He asked, "Take...Take...Have you taken it?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "Take a shit!
No... Served, a hundred... One... 10,000 dissatisfied.
You just happened to win. "
Xiao Xuanzi said: "If you don't accept it, then... you get up and fight."
Wei Xiaobao supported the ground with both hands, just wanting to bounce it hard, but the vital part of his chest was held down by his opponent, and he couldn't use any strength. He was in a stalemate for a long time and had to surrender again.
Xiao Xuanzi stood up, only feeling his arms sore.
Wei Xiaobao managed to stand up, swaying, and said, "Ming'er... I'll fight again tomorrow, you must... You must surrender."
Xiao Xuanzi smiled and said, "If you fight another hundred times, you will... also... It is also a loss. If you have the courage, you will come back tomorrow."
Wei Xiaobao said, "I'm afraid you have no courage, why am I not courageous?"
Dead date, see or leave. "
Xiao Xuanzi said: "Okay, dead date, see or leave."
The two of them started to fight, and they didn't mention gambling money.
Since Xiaoxuanzi didn't mention it, Wei Xiaobao was so happy to pretend to forget. If he wins, he must naturally have money.
