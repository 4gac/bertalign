6. Studio
The story of forty years all began on the day of going to the studio.
The day before, Wu Peizhen said that she would take Wang Qiyao to the studio to play.
Wu Peizhen is that kind of careless girl.
She should have humbled herself because of her ugliness, but because of a good family background and loved by someone, she developed a clear and simple personality, which turned her inferiority into humility. There is a spirit of seeking truth from facts in this humility.
Starting from this humility, she always unintentionally magnifies the merits of others, worships faithfully, and is always ready to dedicate her enthusiasm.
Wang Qiyao does not need to be wary of her being jealous, nor does she need to be jealous of her. On the contrary, she still has some sympathy for her because of her ugliness.
This sympathy made Wang Qiyao generous, and naturally this generosity was only for Wu Peizhen alone.
Wu Peizhen's carelessness is actually just not caring. Wang Qiyao's forgiveness to her is heart-warming, so she doubles to treat her well and repay her kindness.
After two visits, the two became the most intimate friends.
Wang Qiyao and Wu Peizhen are friends, and they are a bit like pushing the focus of life on Wu Peizhen.
Her beauty highlights Wu Peizhen's ugliness, her fineness highlights Wu Peizhen's ruggedness, and her generosity highlights Wu Peizhen's favor, which made Wu Peizhen indebted.
Fortunately, Wu Peizhen can afford it. Her life tasks are not as heavy as Wang Qiyao's. She has a little bit of money, but also a little careless. It is a light body and it means to share with Wang Qiyao.
With such a sharing, the two ends are balanced, and the friendship deepens day by day.
Wu Peizhen has a cousin who works as a lighting worker in a studio. Sometimes when he comes to play, he wears a yellow khaki uniform with brass buttons, which looks a bit showy.
Wu Peizhen didn't care about him in the first place, so Wang Qiyao was all attracted to him.
A place like a studio is a place that female students yearn for. It produces romantic, one kind of movies on the screen that is well-known; the other kind of celebrity anecdotes like gossips off the screen.
The former is false, but it seems true; the latter is true, but it seems false.
Life in the studio, one life is done as two lives.
A girl like Wu Peizhen who can eat and sleep has little dreams. She has only brothers and no sisters. She has been playing games for boys since she was a child, but she has no tricks on girls.
But after making friends with Wang Qiyao, her heart became thinner.
She presented the studio as a gift to Wang Qiyao.
She was very scheming and arranged everything in order and the day was set, before she went to tell Wang Qiyao.
Unexpectedly, Wang Qiyao was still a little reluctant, saying that she had something to do this day, so she could only apologize to her cousin.
So Wu Peizhen kept introducing the fun of the studio to Wang Qiyao, bringing over all the deeds that her cousin usually bragged about, and adding her own imagination.
Things turned upside down for a while, but went to the studio to take care of Wu Peizhen.
When Wang Qiyao finally couldn't help her, and promised to go again on another day, Wu Peizhen seemed to have received another favor and happily went to her cousin to change her life.
In fact, Wang Qiyao is not having trouble on this day, nor is she not interested in the studio. This is just her way of being a person. The more attractive things are, the more you have to maintain a reserved attitude. Does it mean self-protection, or does it mean to be indulgent?
It wouldn't be unreasonable anyway.
It's too early for Wu Peizhen to learn this.
On the way to find her cousin, she was full of gratitude to Wang Qiyao, and felt that she had given herself too much face.
This cousin is a child of her uncle's family.
My uncle is a prodigal son. After short selling a cocoon in Hangzhou, he ran away from home without knowing where he went.
Her mother was usually the most afraid of this relative. She asked for money or food when she came to the house. She also gave a few nasty words and gave her a few nail strokes. Later, she gradually stopped coming and broke the relationship.
Suddenly, when the cousin came again, he was wearing this yellow khaki uniform with brass buttons and two boxes of plain snacks, as if he had made a declaration.
Since then, he will come once every one or two months to talk about interesting things in the studio, but everyone is indifferent, only Wu Peizhen is concerned.
According to the address, she went to Zhaojiabang to find her cousin. In a grass shed, there was a fork on the left and a fork on the right, setting up the ecstasy array.
When she saw that she was a foreigner, they all cast their gazes, and when she was about to ask the way, they all looked back.
When she finally found the door of her cousin, the cousin was not there. The man who lived with him was also a young man. He was wearing glasses and cloth clothes, and asked her to enter the house and wait.
She was a little embarrassed, just standing at the door, naturally attracted curious eyes.
When it was getting dark, I saw my cousin walking around, carrying an oil-soaked paper bag in his hand, thinking it was pork head or something.
She returned home, it was already dinner, and she had to make up a lie to prevaricate her parents, but also took great pains.
But she had no complaints, and saw the bubbles coming out of the soles of her feet when she was washing her feet, and she felt it was worth it.
This night, Wu Peizhen also had a dream about a studio. She dreamed of a woman in costume under the mercury lamp. She looked back and smiled. It was Wang Qiyao, and she couldn't help but wake up.
Her feelings for Wang Qiyao are a bit like a teenager to a young girl, the kind of undesirable love, willing to do anything for her.
She opened her eyes in the dark room and thought to herself: Where is the studio?
On that day, when she went to the studio, Wu Peizhen's excitement was far greater than that of Wang Qiyao, and she was almost uncontrollable.
A classmate asked them where they were going. Wu Peizhen could not say where to go, and while she wringed on Wang Qiyao's arm, she dragged Wang Qiyao away as if the classmate was about to catch up and share their happiness.
She was noisy all the way, causing many passers-by to look back. Wang Qiyao warned a few times without warning, and finally had to stop and say nothing. The studio hadn't arrived, so it was enough to make a fool of yourself.
Only then did Wu Peizhen constrained.
The two got into the car, changed cars, and then went to the studio.
My cousin stood at the door waiting for them, and gave them a sign to hang on their chests, indicating that they were from the factory, so they could leave everywhere.
They put up the cards and walked in with their cousin.
First, I walked on the open space, throwing old wooden boards and old cloth, and broken bricks and shingles everywhere, like a garbage dump and a construction site.
People oncoming walked in a hurry with their heads buried.
The cousin's steps are also fast, as if there are important things to do.
The two of them were left behind, holding hands with each other, trying to speed up their pace.
The sun at three or four o'clock in the afternoon was a little disappointing, and the wind blew close to the ground, blowing up their skirts.
Both of them felt a little gloomy, and Wu Peizhen fell silent.
The three of them walked like this for a while, and the few hundred steps felt like a thousand miles, and the two who followed were impatient.
The cousin slowed down and talked with them about the trivial matters in the studio, but it was a little bit irrelevant.
These trivial things sounded true on the outside, but inside they seemed like rumors, which was not very reliable, and the two of them were in a daze.
Then I walked into a big warehouse-like house, and looked over at it. Workers in uniforms walked up and down, yelling loudly.
There is no one like a star.
They followed their cousin around for a while, being careful about their heads and soles of their feet for a while, and soon lost their way.
There were ropes above and below, and the lights were bright and dark.
They seem to have forgotten their purpose, do not know where they have come, and just walk wholeheartedly.
It seemed that after walking for thousands of miles, my cousin stopped and asked them to watch here. He was going to work.
The place where they are standing is a bit bustling, and people are busy walking past and behind them.
Several times they felt that they were blocking other people's way, so they were busy getting out of the way, but unexpectedly bumped into another person.
And the star-like person is still missing.
They were apprehensive, thinking that they had come by mistake, and Wu Peizhen was even more guilty, afraid to look at Wang Qiyao's face.
At this time, the lights came on, as if more than a dozen suns were rising intersectingly, the light was dazzling, and they saw the furnishings of the half room in front of them.
The three-walled room looks like a set, but everything in it is well-know.
The quilt on the bed is 70% new. There are half of cigarette butts in the ashtray. The handkerchief on the bedside table is used and crumpled into a ball. It seems to be living a life, but a wall has been removed. Show the general public.
I was a little happy when I saw it, and a little bit tired.
Because they stood far away and couldnâ€™t hear what was being said, there was a woman in a nightgown lying on the bed, lying in several positions, one sideways, one upturned, and one half lying down. The body, the other half of the body is hanging down to the ground.
Her translucent nightgown was wrapped around her body, and the bed was wrinkled and a bit greasy.
The light was dimmed several times and brightened several times.
Finally, I was lying down, no longer moving, and the lights dimmed again.
When it lights up again, it seems to be different from the previous few times.
The first few times of light is the kind of bright, bright, unobstructed.
This time, it was a special kind of light, the kind of light that was dark outside but bright inside at midnight.
The view of the room seemed to be a little further away, but it was more vivid, and it seemed to be familiar.
Wang Qiyao noticed that the electric lamp in the setting was emitting real light, and the lotus-shaped lampshade cast rippled shadows on three walls.
It's like reappearing the old scene, but I can't remember when and where the old scene was.
Wang Qiyao then turned her gaze to the woman under the lamp. She suddenly understood that this woman was pretending to be a dead person. She didn't know whether it was suicide or homicide.
Strangely, this situation is not gruesome, but rather familiar.
Wang Qiyao could not see the face of this woman, only saw her tousled curly hair, all piled up at the foot of the bed, because she was lying upside down with her feet on the head of the bed and her head against the foot of the bed. The slippers were east and west. One.
The studio is noisy, like a cargo terminal, and the cries of "Open Myra" and "OK" come and go. Only the woman is immobile and awake for thousands of years.
Wu Peizhen was a little impatient at first, and because she was a little daring, she took Wang Qiyao to look elsewhere.
The next place was slapped, in a restaurant with three walls, all in suits and leather shoes, but a poor man rushed in and slapped the slapstick when he came in.
The pie is a bit funny, the slap is slapped on one's hand, and then put on the other's face, but it looks seamless.
Wu Peizhen likes to watch this, she can't get bored after going back and forth many times, and it's interesting.
But Wang Qiyao was a little impatient, saying that the scene was only interesting, it was a serious film, unlike this, it was all gag and monkey tricks.
The two returned to the shed just now. Unexpectedly, everyone was scattered and the bed was moved away, leaving a few people on the ground to pack their things.
They suspected that they had gone to the wrong place and wanted to find them again, but they heard their cousin call them. It turned out that there was a cousin among those who took care of things.
He asked them to wait for a while before taking them to other places. There is a shed doing stunts today!
They had to stand aside and wait.
Someone asked my cousin who they were. My cousin said and asked them which school they were studying in. My cousin couldn't tell. Wu Peizhen said it by herself. Then the man smiled at them, his white teeth lit up in the dark.
Later, my cousin told them that this man was a director, had studied abroad, and would also write a screenwriter. He wrote and directed the scene he filmed today.
After all, I took them to watch stunts, smoke and fire, and ghosts.
It's all the workers underneath that are tossing about, leaving the actors to do, just blinking.
Wu Peizhen asked her cousin to take them to see the celebrities again, but her cousin was embarrassed, saying that no celebrity scenes were filmed in any studio today, and that the celebrity scenes are not available on all days, nor are they scheduled any day they want God, follow the meaning of stars.
Wu Peizhen then said as if revealing it: Didn't you say that you can see who every day?
Seeing that his cousin couldn't get down, Wang Qiyao said: Come again next time, it's getting dark, and the family will have to wait!
My cousin took them out, and met the director once on the road. He still remembered them and called them female students in XX Middle School. It was so humorous that both of them blushed.
On the tram going back, the two of them were a little too lazy to talk, listening to the buzz of the tram.
The tram is a little empty, the people who are off work have arrived home, and the people who live overnight have not yet left.
The experience on the set was a bit unexpected. It wasn't a disappointment or a fun, all in all I was tired.
Wu Peizhen originally didnâ€™t have much preparation for the studio. Her yearning was born of Wang Qiyao. She naturally hoped that the studio would be as exciting as possible, but she didnâ€™t know what kind of excitement it was, so she wanted Look at Wang Qiyao's attitude to determine her opinion.
The studio's impression of Wang Qiyao is somewhat complicated.
It was not as magical as she had imagined, but because of its ordinaryness, it gave her a handy impression.
What is at your fingertips?
She doesn't know yet.
The original expectation was a little disappointed, but the tension in that expectation was relieved.
After returning from the studio for a few days, she didn't say anything. This frustrated Wu Peizhen, thinking that Wang Qiyao actually didn't like the studio, and going to the studio was all she did.
One day, she told Wang Qiyao in a tone of repentance that her cousin asked them to go to the studio again, but she refused.
Wang Qiyao turned her face and said: How can you be so unreasonable, people are sincere.
Wu Peizhen's eyes widened and looked at her in disbelief. Wang Qiyao was uncomfortable with her, so she turned her head and said: I mean shouldn't give others face, this is your relative!
This time, even Wu Peizhen could see that Wang Qiyao wanted to go and didn't say what she meant. Not only did she not think she was cheating, but also a kind of compassion arose in her heart, thinking that she looked like an adult, but she was actually a child!
At this time, Wu Peizhen's feelings towards Wang Qiyao were a bit like a mother, all-inclusive.
Since then, the studio has become a frequent place for them.
I learned a lot about the tricks of filming, knowing that the shooting was not done in the order of the plot, but shot by shot separately, and finally connected.
The filming scene is too shabby and shabby, but the pictures taken from Kaimailari are always neat and beautiful.
The scorching big stars have really met them once or twice, and when they are in front of the camera, the props generally do nothing.
The script of the movie is changed at will, and the dead become alive in a blink of an eye.
They got into the backstage of the movie and touched the mysterious mechanism, and their hearts changed.
The experience of the studio is indeed an unusual experience, and it carries some life implications.
Especially at their age, there is no distinction between the real and the real, and the truth is not distinguished; and especially in that era, movies have become an important part of our lives.
7. Open Myra
Wang Qiyao knows that the most important and critical moment of making a movie is the moment of "Kamara". Before that, it was all preparation and preparation.
And after that?
It is the end forever.
She saw the unusual meaning of this "Kamara", which was almost close to the culmination.
The director sometimes let them look at the camera, and the camera is always beautiful, filtering out the mess and sloppy.
It also makes the darkness shine.
The world in the lens is another one, after modification and production, it also means essence.
The director has become an acquaintance, and they no longer blush when they see him.
A few times, when my cousin was not in the studio, they went to him directly.
On his own initiative, he called one of them "Zhenzhen" and the other "Yaoyao", as if they had become characters in his play.
He secretly told the people in the studio that Zhenzhen is a girl, but the rough girl next to Jia Mu in Rongguo Mansion, like the silly eldest sister;
Yaoyao is like a lady, but she is a lady from outside the family, Zhu Yingtai and his like.
He treats Wu Peizhen as a child, likes to tease her and make some jokes;
To Wang Qiyao, she said that there was a chance to let her take the last shot, because her eyebrows were a bit like Ruan Lingyu. Taking advantage of people's nostalgia for Ruan Lingyu, she might be able to win a star.
It's also a bit of a joke, but it's much more subtle.
Of course, Wang Qiyao wouldn't take it seriously, but she liked the similarity between herself and Ruan Lingyu.
But one day, the director actually called home and asked her to try the shot.
Wang Qiyao's heart was pounding, her palms felt a little cold, she didn't know if it was an opportunity, she thought, is it so easy to get an opportunity?
She didn't believe it, and didn't dare not believe it, she was struggling.
She didn't want to tell Wu Peizhen, she went quietly, and then quietly returned. Even if there was no result, only she knew it, as if it had never happened.
But when that day came, she still told Wu Peizhen, asking her to go with her, just to be bold.
She didn't sleep well at night, there was a blush under her eyes, and her chin was a bit pointed.
Wu Peizhen was naturally excited and dreaming. In a blink of an eye, she was already planning a press conference for Wang Qiyao.
Wang Qiyao regretted telling her when she heard her noise.
Neither of them had a good class on this day, and their hearts flew to nowhere.
When school finally ended, the two walked out of the school gate and got on the tram.
The trams at this time are mostly housewife-like women with cloth bags in their hands. The cheongsams on their bodies are wrinkled, and the stockings on the back of their legs are not aligned with the seams. They are a little bit off, their hair is unkempt, or He just came out of the barbershop and wore a helmet, with a wooden expression on his face, as if he didn't care about everything.
The tram croaked on the track, with an indifferent expression.
The two of them are active in this indifference. Although they are silent, they are brewing for hundreds of years.
The road at three o'clock in the afternoon was exhausted, and I was preparing for the end and shift.
The sun is on the building on the west side of the road, the color is yellow.
The two of them seemed to have started the day, and there was a lot of waiting in their hearts.
The director first led them into the dressing room and asked a makeup artist to apply makeup to Wang Qiyao.
When Wang Qiyao saw her image in the mirror, she felt that her face was so small and her facial features were so simple. There would be no miracles, and she couldn't help feeling depressed.
She was played by a makeup artist, with a resigned expression. For a while, she closed her eyes and did not look in the mirror.
She felt very embarrassed and wished it all ended soon;
She was also a little nervous, thinking that the makeup artist also wished to end soon, her hand movements would inevitably be irritable and rough.
She opened her eyes and looked at the mirror again. She was embarrassed in the mirror, her eyes and nose looked like a last resort.
The light in the dressing room is ample and evenly distributed, without cadence and frustration, it looks a little flat and straightforward.
Wang Qiyao didn't have any confidence in herself. Instead, she was willing to open her eyes wide to see the makeup artist's technique, watching herself become a stranger little by little.
At this time, she calmed down and her mood relaxed. When the makeup artist finished her work and walked away, she even had a sense of humor to joke with Wu Peizhen.
Wu Peizhen said that she was like Chang'e going down to earth, so she said that Chang'e was also Chang'e on the mooncake box, so both of them laughed.
With a smile, the expression stretched, and the color of the powder was alive and vivid.
Looking at the beauty in the mirror again, there is no such thing as life and separation.
After a while, the director sent someone to greet her, and Wu Peizhen naturally followed.
The lamp stands in the shed are all set up. Then Wu Peizhenâ€™s cousin smiled at her from a high place, but the director became very serious. The six relatives did not recognize her and appointed her to sit on a bed, a kind of peaceful sleeping bed. The tall tent, carved with flowers on the frame and inlaid with mirrors, is the gorgeousness of the country folks.
The director told her that she is now a bride in an old-style wedding, wearing a red hijab, and then a groom officer came to uncover the hijab, revealing her face bit by bit.
The director stipulated that she was shy, charming, longing and worried, and gave her all these adjectives all in one face.
Although Wang Qiyao nodded, her heart was at a loss, and she was still in a daze, not knowing where to start.
But at this time, she was just going out, but she was very calm. She was able to notice her surroundings and heard the cry of "Kai Mella" coming from the neighboring shed.
Then, a red hijab came up, and his eyes darkened steeply.
At this time, Wang Qiyao's heart jumped like a drum.
She realized that this moment was coming, and her knees trembled slightly with fear in her heart.
The lights were all bright, and the darkness in front of me turned into melting red. Although there was light, it was the light that was unknown.
Wang Qiyao was feverish, and the shiver rose along her knees, and her teeth bumped.
The magic in the studio gathers and waits in the light.
Someone came over, sorted her clothes, walked away again, brought a gust of wind, the red hijab moved a bit, stroking her face, it was a gentleness in the tension of the afternoon.
She heard a series of "OK" sounds all around, in a progressive rhythm, somewhat agitated, rushing towards a goal in one heart, and in the end it was a "Open Myra".
Wang Qiyao held her breath and couldn't breathe. She heard the mechanical sound of Kai Myra moving away. This sound covered everything. She completely forgot what she should do.
When the red hijab was removed with one hand, she was suddenly shocked, and she shrank back, and the director screamed to stop.
When the lights are dimmed, put the red hood on and start from the beginning.
It's just a matter of nothing since it comes again.
Many scenes are gone and no longer reappear. They were originally hallucinations.
Wang Qiyao woke up, the shivering stopped, and her heartbeat returned to normal.
The dark in the red hijab adapted and could distinguish the active figure.
The light is on, it is a routine, a series of "OK" is also a routine, the sound of "Kamara" is a routine, but it is also authoritative, with a little constant shock.
She began to prepare for her face according to the director's explanation, but she didn't know how to be shy, charming, longing and worrying.
There was no sign of happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy, and there was no place to even copy one.
When the red hijab was lifted, her face was only wooden, and even the charm she was born with was also wooden.
The director has already noticed his own mistakes in the camera. Wang Qiyao's beauty is not the kind of literary beauty. Her beauty is somewhat homely. It is for her own appreciation in the guest room, and it is the sentiment of living.
She is not the beauty of turmoil, but the beauty of inflexibility.
Her Meili lacks a bit of poetry, but she is loyal and honest.
Her beauty is not dramatic, but life-like. It is the beauty in the window of a photo studio when someone is watching on the road.
From the perspective of Kai Malari, it was too plain.
The director was not disappointed. His disappointment also meant Wang Qiyao. He thought that her beauty was about to be buried.
Later, in order to compensate, he invited a photographer friend to take some life photos for Wang Qiyao. These life photos were really different. One of them was used in the front cover of "Shanghai Life" with the name "Shanghai Shuyuan". As the title.
The experience of testing shots ended in this way. This is a trivial matter in the studio.
Wang Qiyao never went to the studio anymore. She wanted to forget about it, preferably it never happened.
But with a red hijab, the brightly lit scene grows in my heart, and it will appear when I close my eyes.
There was an unpredictable throbbing in that scene, which was a dramatic moment in Wang Qiyao's peaceful life.
This fleeting moment left a sentimental color in Wang Qiyao's heart.
Sometimes on the way home after school, something unexpected evokes the memories of the afternoon when I went to try the shot.
Wang Qiyao is sixteen years old this year. This incident gave her a sense of vicissitudes. She felt that she was more than sixteen years old.
She still avoided Wu Peizhen a little bit, as if she had been watching for some details.
When Wu Peizhen asked her to go after school, nine times out of ten she found reasons to refuse.
Wu Peizhen visited her house several times to play with her, and she also asked her mother to say not to push at home.
Wu Peizhen felt Wang Qiyao's avoidance and couldn't help feeling sad.
But she did not lose her confidence. She felt that no matter how many days passed, Wang Qiyao would eventually return to her.
Her friendship turned into pious waiting. She didn't even go to make a new girlfriend because she didn't want others to occupy Wang Qiyao's position.
She also vaguely realized the reason why Wang Qiyao avoided it. It seemed to be related to the failed test shot. She stopped going to the studio and even broke up with her cousin.
This trial shot turned into a sad thing for both of them, and both harbored some sense of failure.
Later, they gradually didn't even speak much, and they hurriedly avoided meeting with a little embarrassment.
When they sat at the two ends of the class, although they did not look at each other, they all felt each other's existence, and an atmosphere of sympathy similar to that grew between them.
The event of going to the studio ended with a "open myra", which has an effect called "freeze frame" in the movie, which is never returned, but also remembered forever.
Nowadays, my after-school life has returned to the old way, and there is a little new deprivation in the old way, my heart is a little hurt, and I donâ€™t understand where it is.
The girls' school, where the wind is rain, was silent about Wang Qiyao's shooting this time, and kept it tight.
Although the two did not tell each other, they kept silent at the same time.
In fact, in the eyes of average female students, it is glorious enough to be able to look like a director, and success is an extravagant hope.
This is also what Wang Qiyao and the others had originally thought, but once they have reached that point, the situation is not the old days, and people are not old people. They have paid a price and some losses.
If it weren't for Wu Peizhen, a bystander who compares his heart to heart, he would not have tasted this state of mind.
