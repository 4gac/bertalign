wang miao drive along jingmi road until he be in miyun county .
from there he head to heilongtan , climb up the mountain along a wind road , and arrive at the radio astronomy observatory of the chinese academy of sciences ' national astronomical center .
he see a line of twenty-eight parabolic antenna dish , each with a diameter of nine meter , like a row of spectacular steel plant .
at the end be two tall radio telescope with dish fifty meter in diameter , build in 2006 .
as he drive closer , wang could not help but think of the background in the picture of ye and she daughter .
but the work of sha ruishan , ye 's student , have nothing to do with these radio telescope .
dr. sha 's lab be mainly responsible for receive the datum transmit from three satellite : the cosmic background explorer , cobe , launch in november of 1989 and about to be retire ; the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , wmap , launch in 2003 ; and planck , the space observatory launch by the european space agency in 2009 .
cosmic microwave background radiation very precisely match the thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.7255 k and be highly isotropic — meaning nearly uniform in every direction — with only tiny temperature fluctuation at the part per million range .
sha ruishan 's job be to create a more detailed map of the cosmic microwave background use observational datum .
the lab be not very big .
equipment for receive satellite datum be squeeze into the main computer room , and three terminal display the information send by the three satellite .
sha be excite to see wang .
clearly bore with he long isolation and happy to have a visitor , he ask wang what kind of datum he want to see .
" i want to see the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background . "
" can you ... be more specific ? "
" what i mean be ...
i want to see the isotropic fluctuation in the overall cosmic microwave background , between one and five percent , " he say , quote from shen 's email .
sha grin .
start at the turn of the century , the miyun radio astronomy observatory have open itself to visitor .
in order to earn some extra income , sha often play the role of tour guide or give lecture .
this be the grin he reserve for tourist , as he have grow use to they astounding scientific illiteracy .
" mr. wang , i take it you be not a specialist in the field ? "
" i work in nanotech . "
" ah , make sense .
but you must have some basic understanding of the cosmic microwave background ? "
" i do not know much .
i know that as the universe cool after the big bang , the leftover 'em ber ' become the cosmic microwave background .
the radiation fill the entire universe and can be observe in the centimeter wavelength range .
i think it be back in the sixty when two americans accidentally discover the radiation when they be test a supersensitive satellite reception antenna — "
" that be more than enough , " sha interrupted , wave he hand .
" then you must know that unlike the local variation we observe in different part of the universe , the overall fluctuation in the cosmic microwave background be correlate with the expansion of the universe .
it be a very slow change measure at the scale of the age of the universe .
even with the sensitivity of the planck satellite , continuous observation for a million year might not detect any such shift .
but you want to see a five percent fluctuation tonight ?
do you realize what that would mean ?
the universe would flicker like a fluorescent tube that be about to burn out ! "
and it will be flicker for i , wang think .
" this must be some joke from professor ye , " sha say .
" nothing would please i more than to discover that it be a joke , " wang say .
he be about to tell sha that ye do not know the detail of he request , but he be afraid that sha would then refuse to help he .
" well , since professor ye ask i to help you , let 's do the observation .
it be not a big deal .
if you just need one percent precision , datum from the antique cobe be sufficient . "
as he speak , sha type quickly at the terminal .
soon a flat green line appear on the screen .
" this curve be the real-time measurement of the overall cosmic microwave background — oh , call it a straight line would be more accurate .
the temperature be 2.725 ± 0.002 k.
the error range be due to the doppler effect from the motion of the milky way , which have already be filter out .
if the kind of fluctuation you anticipate — in excess of one percent — occur , this line would turn red and become a waveform .
i would bet that it be go to stay a flat green line until the end of the world , though .
if you want to see it show the kind of fluctuation observable by the naked eye , you might have to wait until long after the death of the sun . "
" i be not interfere in you work , be i ? "
" no. .
since you need such low precision , we can just use some basic datum from cobe .
okay , it be all set .
from now on , if such great fluctuation occur , the datum will be automatically save to disk . "
" i think it might happen around one o'clock a.m. "
" wow , so precise !
no problem , since i be work the night shift , anyway .
have you have dinner yet ?
good , then i 'll take you on a tour . "
the night be moonless .
they walk along the row of antenna dish , and sha point to they .
" breathtaking , be not they ?
it be too bad that they be all like the ear of a deaf man . "
" why ? "
" ever since construction be complete , interference have be unceasing in the observational band .
first , there be the paging station during the eighty .
now , it be the scramble to develop mobile communication network and cell tower .
these telescope be capable of many scientific task — survey the sky , detect variable radio source , observe the remains of supernova — but we can not perform most of they .
we have complain to the state regulatory radio commission many time , never with any result .
how can we get more attention than china mobile , china unicom , china netcom ?
without money , the secret of the universe be worth shit .
at least my project only depend on satellite datum and have nothing to do with these ' tourist attraction . ' "
" in recent year , commercial operation of basic research have be fairly successful , like in high-energy physics .
maybe it would be better if the observatory be build in place farther away from city ? "
" it all come down to money .
right now , we only choice be to find technical means to shield against interference .
well , it would be much better if professor ye be here .
she accomplish a lot in this field . "
so the topic of conversation turn to ye wenjie .
and from she student , wang finally learn about she life .
he listen as sha tell of how she witness the death of she father during the cultural revolution , how she be falsely accuse at the production and construction corps , how she then seem to disappear until she return to beijing at the beginning of the ninety , when she begin teach astrophysics at tsinghua , where she father have also teach , until she retirement .
" it be only recently reveal that she have spend more than twenty year at red coast base . "
wang be stunned .
" you mean , those rumor — "
" most turn out to be true .
one of the researcher who develop the decipher system for the red coast project emigrate to europe and write a book last year .
most of the rumor you hear come out of that book .
many who participate in red coast be still alive . "
" that be ... a fantastical legend . "
" especially for it to happen during those year — absolutely incredible . "
they continue to speak for a while .
sha ask the purpose behind wang 's strange request .
wang avoid give a straight answer , and sha do not press .
the dignity of a specialist do not allow sha to express too much interest in a request that clearly go against he professional knowledge .
then they go to a all-night bar for tourist and sit for two hour .
as sha finish one beer after another , he tongue loosen even more .
but wang become anxious , and he mind keep return to that green line on the terminal in sha 's office .
it be only at ten to one in the morning that sha finally give in to wang 's repeat plea to go back to the lab .
the spotlight that have light up the row of radio antenna have be turn off , and the antenna now form a simple two-dimensional picture against the night sky like a series of abstract symbol .
all of they gaze up at the sky at the same angle , as though wait expectantly for something .
the scene make wang shudder despite the warmth of the spring evening .
he be remind of the giant pendulum in three body .
they arrive back at the lab at one .
as they look at the terminal , the fluctuation be just get start .
the flat line turn into a wave , the distance between one peak and the next inconstant .
the line 's color become red , like a snake awakening after hibernation , wriggle as its skin refill with blood .
" it must be a malfunction in cobe ! "
sha stare at the waveform , terrify .
" it be not a malfunction . "
wang 's tone be exceedingly calm .
he have learn to control himself when face with such sight .
" we 'll know soon enough , " sha say .
he go to the other two terminal and type rapidly to bring up the datum gather by the other two satellite , wmap and planck .
now three waveform move in sync across the three terminal , exactly alike .
sha take out a notebook computer and rush to turn it on .
he plug in a network cable and pick up the phone .
wang could tell from the one-sided conversation that he be try to get in touch with the Ürümqi radio astronomy observatory .
he do not explain to wang what he be do , he eye lock onto the browser window on the notebook .
wang could hear he rapid breathing .
a few minute later , a red waveform appear in the browser window , move in step with the other three .
the three satellite and the ground-based observatory confirm one fact : the universe be flicker .
" can you print out the waveform ? " wang ask .
sha wipe away the cold sweat on he forehead and nod .
he move he mouse and click " print . "
wang grab the first page as soon as it come out of the laser printer , and , with a pencil , begin to match the distance between the peak with the morse code chart he take out of he pocket .
short-long-long-long-long , short-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-short-short , long-long-long-short-short-short , short-short-long-long-long , short-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-short-short-short , short-short-short-long-long , long-long-short-short-short .
that be 1108:21:37 , wang think .
short-long-long-long-long , short-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-short-short , long-long-long-short-short-short , short-short-long-long-long , short-long-long-long-long , long-long-long-short-short-short , short-short-short-long-long , long-short-short-short-short — that be 1108:21:36 .
the countdown continue at the scale of the universe .
ninety-two hour have already elapse , and only 1,108 hour remain .
sha pace back and forth anxiously , pause from time to time to look at the sequence of number wang be write down .
" can not you tell i what be go on ? " he shout .
" i can not possibly explain this to you , dr. sha .
trust i . "
wang push away the pile of papers fill with waveform .
as he stare at the sequence of number , he say , " maybe the three satellite and the observatory be all malfunction . "
" you know that be impossible ! "
" what if it be sabotage ? "
" also impossible !
to simultaneously alter the datum from three satellite and a observatory on earth ?
you be talk about a supernatural saboteur . "
wang nod .
compare to the idea of the universe flickering , he would prefer a supernatural saboteur .
but sha then deprive he of this last glimmer of hope .
" it be easy to confirm this .
if the cosmic microwave background be fluctuate this much , we should be able to see it with we own eye . "
" what be you talk about ?
the wavelength of the cosmic microwave background be seven centimeter .
that be five order of magnitude longer than the wavelength of visible light .
how can we possibly see it ? "
" use 3k glass . "
" three-k glass ? "
" it be a sort of science toy we make for the capital planetarium .
with we current level of technology , we could take the six-meter horn antenna use by penzias and wilson almost half a century ago to discover the cosmic microwave background and miniaturize it to the size of a pair of glass .
then we add a converter in the glass to compress the detect radiation by five order of magnitude so that seven-centimeter wave be turn into visible red light .
this way , visitor can put on the glass at night and observe the cosmic microwave background on they own .
and now , we can use it to see the universe flicker . "
" where can i find these glass ? "
" at the capital planetarium .
we make more than twenty pair . "
" i must get my hand on a pair before five . "
sha pick up the phone .
the other side pick up only after a long while .
sha have to expend a lot of energy to convince the person awaken in the middle of the night to go to the planetarium and wait for wang 's arrival in a hour .
as wang leave , sha say , " i will not go with you .
what i have see be enough , and i do not need any more confirmation .
but i hope that you will explain the truth to i when you feel the time be right .
if this phenomenon should lead to some research result , i will not forget you . "
wang open the car door and say , " the flickering will stop at five in the morning .
i would suggest you not pursue it after this .
believe i , you will not get anywhere . "
sha stare at wang for a long time and then nod .
" i understand .
strange thing have be happen to scientist lately .... "
" yes . "
wang duck into the car .
he do not want to discuss the subject any further .
" be it we turn ? "
" it be my turn , at least . "
wang start the engine .
a hour later , wang arrive at the new planetarium and get out of the car .
the bright light of the city penetrate the translucent wall of the immense glass building and dimly reveal its internal structure .
wang think that if the architect have intend to express a feeling about the universe , the design be a success :
the more transparent something be , the more mysterious it seem .
the universe itself be transparent ; as long as you be sufficiently sharp-eyed , you could see as far as you like .
but the farther you look , the more mysterious it become .
the sleepy-eyed planetarium staffer be wait by the door for wang .
he hand he a small suitcase and say , " there be five pair of 3k glass in here , all fully charge .
the left button switch it on .
the right dial be for adjust brightness .
i have a dozen more pair upstairs .
you can look as much as you like , but i be go to take a nap now in the room over there .
this dr. sha must be mental . "
he go into the dim interior of the planetarium .
wang open the suitcase on the backseat of he car and take out a pair of 3k glass .
it resemble the display inside the panoramic view helmet of the v-suit .
he put the glass on and look around .
the city look the same as before , only dimmer .
then he remember that he have to switch they on .
the city turn into many hazy glowing halo .
most be fix , but a few flicker or move .
he realize that these be source of radiation in the centimeter range , all now convert to visible light .
at the heart of each halo be a radiation source .
because the original wavelength be so long , it be impossible to see they shape clearly .
he lift he head and see a sky glowing with a faint red light .
just like that , he be see the cosmic microwave background .
the red light have come from more than ten billion year ago .
it be the remnant of the big bang , the still-warm ember of creation .
he could not see any star .
normally , since visible light would be compress to invisible by the glass , each star should appear as a black dot .
but the diffraction of centimeter-wave radiation overwhelm all other shape and detail .
once he eye have grow use to the sight , wang could see that the faint red background be indeed pulsing .
the entire sky flicker , as if the universe be but a quiver lamp in the wind .
stand under the flash dome of the night sky , wang suddenly feel the universe shrink until it be so small that only he be imprison in it .
the universe be a cramped heart , and the red light that suffuse everything be the translucent blood that fill the organ .
suspend in the blood , he see that the flickering of the red light be not periodic — the pulse be irregular .
he feel a strange , perverse , immense presence that could never be understand by human intellect .
wang take off the 3k glass and sit down weakly on the ground , lean against the wheel of he car .
the city at night gradually recover the reality of visible light .
but he eye roam , try to capture other sight .
by the entrance of the zoo across the street , there be a row of neon light .
one of the light be about to burn out and flicker irregularly .
nearby , a small tree 's leaf tremble in the night breeze , twinkle without pattern as they reflect streetlight .
in the distance , the red star atop the beijing exhibition center 's russian-style spire reflect the light from the car pass below , also twinkle randomly ....
wang try to interpret the flicker as morse code .
he even feel that the wrinkle in the flag flap next to he and the ripple in the puddle on the side of the road might be send he message .
he struggle to understand all the message , and feel the passing of the countdown , second by second .
he do not know how long he stay there .
the planetarium staffer finally emerge and ask he whether he be do .
but when he see wang 's face , sleep disappear from the staffer 's eye and be replace by fear .
he pack up the 3k glass , stare at wang for a few seconds , and quickly leave with the suitcase .
wang take out he mobile and dial shen yufei 's number .
she pick up right away .
perhaps she be also suffer from insomnia .
" what happen at the end of the countdown ? " wang ask .
" i do not know . "
she hang up .
what can it be ?
maybe my own death , like yang dong 's .
or maybe it will be a disaster like the great tsunami that sweep through the indian ocean more than a decade ago .
no one will connect it to my nanotech research .
could it be that every previous great disaster , include the two world war , be also the result of reach the end of ghostly countdown ?
could it be that every time there be someone like i , who no one thought of , who bear the ultimate responsibility ?
or maybe it signal the end of the whole world .
in this perverse world , that would be a relief .
one thing be certain .
no matter what be at the end of the countdown , in the remain one thousand or so hour , the possibility would torture he cruelly , like demon , until he suffer a complete mental breakdown .
wang duck back into the car and leave the planetarium .
just before dawn , the road be relatively empty .
but he do not dare to drive too fast , feeling that the faster the car move , the faster the countdown would go .
when a glimmer of light appear in the eastern sky , he park and walk around aimlessly .
he mind be empty of thought : only the countdown pulsed against the dim red background of cosmic radiation .
he seem to have turn into nothing but a simple timer , a bell that toll for he know not whom .
the sky brighten .
he be tired , so he sit down on a bench .
when he lift he head to see where he subconscious have bring he , he shiver .
he sit in front of st. joseph 's church at wangfujing .
in the pale white light of dawn , the church 's romanesque vault appear as three giant finger point out something in space for he .
as wang get up to leave , he be hold back by a snippet of hymnal music .
it be not sunday , so it be likely a choir rehearsal .
the song be " come , gracious spirit , heavenly dove . "
as he listen to the solemn , sacred music , wang miao once again feel that the universe have shrink until it be the size of a empty church .
the domed ceiling be hide by the flash red light of the background radiation , and he be a ant crawl through the crack in the floor .
he feel a giant , invisible hand caress he tremble heart , and he be once again a helpless babe .
something deep in he mind that have once hold he up soften like wax and collapse .
he cover he eye and begin to cry .
wang 's cry be interrupt by laughter .
" hahaha , another one bite the dust ! "
he turn around .
captain shi qiang stand there , blow out a mouthful of white smoke .
