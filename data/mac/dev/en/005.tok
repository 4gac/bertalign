the film studio
four decade the story span , and it all begin the day she go to the film studio .
the day before , wu peizhen have agree to take wang qiyao to have a look around the studio .
wu peizhen be a rather careless girl .
under normal circumstance , she would have suffer from low self-esteem because of she homeliness , but because peizhen come from a well-to-do family and people always dote on she , she have develop unaffected into a outgoing young lady .
what would have be poor self-esteem be replace by a kind of modesty — modesty rule by a practical spirit .
in she modesty , she tend to exaggerate other people 's strength , place they on a pedestal , and offer they she devotion .
wang qiyao never have to worry about wu peizhen be jealous of she — and she certainly have no reason to be jealous of wu peizhen .
on the contrary , she even feel a bit bad for wu peizhen — because she be so ugly .
this compassion predispose wang qiyao to be generous , but naturally this generosity do not extend any further than wu peizhen .
wu peizhen 's carelessness be the function of a uncalculating mind .
she appreciate wang qiyao 's magnanimity and try even harder to please she as though repay she kindness .
bask in each other 's company , they become the best of friend .
but wang qiyao 's decision to befriend wu peizhen mean , in some way , that she be push a heavy load onto wu peizhen 's shoulder .
she beauty highlight wu peizhen 's unattractive appearance ; she meticulousness highlight wu peizhen 's lack of care ; she magnanimity highlight wu peizhen 's indebtedness .
it be a good thing that wu peizhen could take it ; after all , the weight of everyday living do not rest as heavily on she .
this be partly because she have plenty of psychic capital to draw on , but also because she simply do not mind .
thing come easy to she and she be willing to bear more than she share .
thus a equilibrium of give-and-take be maintain between the two girl and they grow closer by the day .
wu peizhen have a cousin who do lighting at the film studio .
occasionally he would come over to see she .
in that khaki uniform of he , with its copper button , he come across as a bit flashy .
wu peizhen really could not have care less about he ; the only reason she keep he around be for wang qiyao .
the film studio be the stuff of girl ' dream — a place where romance be create , the kind that appear on the silver screen in movie that everyone know as well as the off-screen type that one hear about in the enchanting gossip and rumor surround the life of film star .
the former be fake but appear real ; the latter be real but seem fake .
to live in the world of the film studio be to lead a dual life .
girl like wu peizhen who have all of they need take care of seldom wallow in dream ; moreover , as the only girl in a house full of boy , she grow up play boy ' game and never learn the social skill and canniness most girl pick up .
however , after make friend with wang qiyao , she become more thoughtful .
she come to see the film studio as a gift that she could offer to wang qiyao .
she arrange everything carefully , only inform wang qiyao after she have already set a date , and be surprise when wang qiyao greet the news with apparent indifference , claim a prior engagement .
this compel wu peizhen to try to change wang qiyao 's mind by exaggerate the glamour of the film studio , combine story she cousin brag about with other from she own imagination .
before long , it be more like wang qiyao be do she a favor by go with she .
by the time wang qiyao finally give in and agree to go some other time , wu peizhen be act as if yet another gift that she herself have to be thankful for have be bestow upon she , and she ecstatically scurry off to find she cousin to change the date .
wang qiyao do not , in fact , have any prior engagement , nor be she as reluctant as she appear ; this be simply the way she conduct herself — the more interested she be in something , the more she hold back .
this be she means of protect herself — or then again , be it part of a strategy of disarm a antagonist by pretend to set she free ?
whatever the reason behind she action , it be impenetrable to wu peizhen .
on she way to she cousin 's place , she be consume with gratitude for wang qiyao ; all she could think about be how much face wang qiyao have give she by agree to the invitation .
the cousin be the son of wu peizhen 's uncle on she mother 's side .
this uncle be the black sheep of the family .
he have drive a silk shop in hangzhou into the ground and wu peizhen 's mother have dread he visit because all he ever want from she be money or grain .
after she give he some heavy dose of harsh word and turn he away empty-hand several time , he gradually stop come around and eventually break off all relation .
then one day he son have show up at she door wear that khaki uniform with copper button and carry two box of vegetarian dim sum as if they represent some kind of announcement .
ever since then he would come by once every two month or so and tell they story about the film studio .
nobody in the house be interested in he story — nobody , that be , except wu peizhen .
wu peizhen go to the address in qijiabing in search of she cousin .
all around be thatch-covered shack surround by small unmarked trail that extend in different direction , make it virtually impossible to find one 's way .
people stare at she .
one glance tell they that she be a outsider , but just as she be get ready to ask direction they would immediately look away .
she finally find she cousin 's place , only to discover that he be not home .
the young man who share the shack with she cousin ask she in .
he be wear a pair of glass and a set of coarse cotton clothes .
wu peizhen be a bit shy and wait outside .
this naturally draw more curious gaze .
it be not until dusk that she cousin finally stagger in with a greasy paper bag hold a pig 's head or some other cheap meat he have buy over at the butcher 's shop .
by the time wu peizhen get home , she family be already at the dinner table and she have to fib about where she have be .
but she do not have a ounce of regret ; even when later that evening she see the blister on the sole of she foot from all that walking , she still feel that it be all worth it .
that night she even have a dream about the film studio .
she dream of a elegantly dress woman under the mercury-vapor lamp .
when the woman turn to she and smile , wu peizhen see that she be none other than wang qiyao ; she be so excited that she wake up .
she feeling for wang qiyao be a bit like the puppy love that a teenage boy feel for a girl for whom he be willing to go to the edge of the earth .
she open she eye in the pitch-dark bedroom and wonder : just what kind of place be this film studio anyway ?
when the day finally arrive , wu peizhen 's excitement far surpass that of wang qiyao ; she could barely contain herself .
a classmate ask they where they be off to .
" nowhere , " wu peizhen casually respond , as she give wang qiyao a know pinch on the arm .
then she pull wang qiyao aside and tell she to hurry up , as though afraid that that they classmate would catch up and force they to let she in on they pleasure .
the whole way there wu peizhen could not stop jabber , attract curious glance from people on the street .
wang qiyao warn she several time to get hold of herself .
finally she have to stop in she track and declare she be not go any further — they have not even set foot in the studio and wu peizhen have already embarrassed she enough .
only then do wu peizhen cool down a bit .
to get to the studio they have to take the trolley and make a transfer .
wu peizhen 's cousin be wait for they at the entrance ; he give each of they a id tag to clip on she chest so that they would look like employee : that way they could wander around wherever they heart desire .
once inside , they walk through a empty lot litter with wooden plank , discard cloth scrap , and chunk of broken brick and tile — it look like a cross between a dump and a construction site .
everyone approach go at a hurry pace with they head down .
the cousin also move briskly , as if he have something urgent to take care of .
the two girl be leave straggle behind , hold hand , try they best to keep up .
it be three or four o'clock , the sunlight be wane and the wind pick up , rustling they skirt .
both of they feel a bit gloomy and wu peizhen fall silent .
after go a few hundred step , they journey begin to feel interminable , and the girl begin to lose patience with the cousin , who slow down to regale they with some of the rumor float around the studio ; he comment , however , seem to be neither here nor there .
before they visit all of those anecdote seem real , but once they have see the place everything be now entirely unreliable .
numbness have take hold of they by the time they enter a large room the size of a warehouse , where uniformed worker scurry back and forth , up and down scaffolding , all the while call out order and direction .
but they do not see a soul who even faintly resemble a movie star .
thoroughly disoriented , they simply trail after wu peizhen 's cousin , but have to watch they head one second and they foot another , for there be rope and wire overhead and litter the ground .
they move in and out from illuminate area into patch of darkness and seem to have completely forget they objective and have no idea where they be — all they do be walk .
after what seem a eternity , wu peizhen 's cousin finally stop and have they stand off to one side — he have to go to work .
the place where they be leave standing be bustling with activity ; everyone seem to be do something as they move briskly around the girl .
several time , rush to get out of one person 's way , they bump into someone else .
but they have yet to lay eye on anyone who look like a movie star .
they be both get anxious , feel that the whole trip be a mistake .
wu peizhen could hardly bring herself to look wang qiyao in the eye .
all of a sudden , the light in the room light up like a dozen rise sun , blind they .
after they eye adjust they make out a portion of the warehouse-like room that have be arrange to look like one half of a bedroom .
that three-walled bedroom seem to be the set , but everything inside be peculiarly familiar .
the comforter show sign of wear , old cigarette butt be leave in the ashtray , even the handkerchief on the nightstand beside the bed have be use , crumple up into a ball — as if someone have remove a wall in a home where real people be live to display what go on within .
stand there watch they be quite excited , but at the same time irritated because they be too far away to hear what be be say on set .
all they could see be a woman in a sheer nightgown lie on a bed with wrinkled sheet .
she try to lie in several different position ; on she side one moment , on she back the next , and for a while even in a strange position where half she body extend off the bed onto the floor .
all this become somewhat boring .
the light turn on and off .
in the end , the woman in bed stop move and stay still in the same position for quite some time before the light once again dim .
when the light come back on , everything seem different .
during the previous few take the light have be mark by a unbridled brilliance .
this time they seem to be use a specialize lighting , the kind that illuminate a room during a pitch-black night .
the bedroom set seem to be further away , but the scene become even more alive .
wang qiyao be take in everything .
she notice the glow emit from the electric lamp and the ripple shadow of the lotus-shaped lampshade project onto the three wall of the set .
a powerful sense of déjà vu grip she , but no matter how hard she try , she could not remember where she have see this scene before .
only after shift she gaze to the woman under the lamplight do she suddenly realize that the actress be pretend to be dead — but she could not tell if the woman be mean to have be murder or to have commit suicide .
the strange thing be that this scene do not appear terrifying or foreboding , only annoyingly familiar .
she could not make out the woman 's feature ; all she could see be she head of disheveled hair strew out along the foot of the bed .
the woman 's foot face the headboard and she head lay prop against the foot of the bed , she slipper scatter on opposite side of the room .
the film studio be a hubbub of activity , like a busy dockyard .
with all the cry of " camera " and " ok " rise and fall amid the clamor , the woman be the only thing that do not move , as if she have fall into a eternal slumber .
wu peizhen be the first to lose she patience ; after all , she be the more brazen one .
she pull wang qiyao away so they could go look around other part of the studio .
they next stop be a three-walled hotel lobby where a fight scene be be shoot .
all of the actor , in suit and leather dress shoe , be stand around when suddenly a poor fellow in tattered clothes walk onto the set and slap the hotel manager across the face .
the way the action be carry out look a bit ridiculous ; the actor produce the slapping sound with he left hand as he slap the restaurant owner with he right , but he timing be impeccable and one could hardly tell it be fake .
wu peizhen like this scene much more than the first .
she watch they do take after take without get bored , the whole time exclaim how much fun it be .
wang qiyao , however , grow impatient and say that the first one be much more interesting .
she say that it be a serious film , unlike this one , which be pure buffoonery , no better than a circus sideshow .
the two return to the first set only to discover that everyone have go .
even the bed have be take away , leave only a few worker behind to straighten up the remain item on set .
the girl wonder if they have go to the wrong place and be about to go look elsewhere when wu peizhen 's cousin suddenly call out to they .
as it happen , he be one of the worker break down the set .
he tell they to wait a little while , and then he would take they to watch a special effect shoot that be go on at one of the other set !
they have no choice but to stand off to one side and wait idly .
someone ask the cousin who he guest be and he tell he .
but when the man ask where they go to school , the cousin be stump and wu peizhen have to answer for herself .
the man flash they a smile , reveal a set of white tooth that shimmer in the darkness of the studio .
he be the director , the cousin later tell they .
he have study abroad and be also a screenwriter ; in fact he have write and direct the scene they have earlier see be film .
the cousin tell they all this as he lead they off to see the special effect shoot , where they see smoke , fire , even ghost .
once again the technical people be do all the work while the actor do virtually nothing .
ask by wu peizhen if they could see some movie star , the cousin look embarrassed .
he tell they that there be not a single big star on any of the set that day , explain that it be not every day that big movie star have scene .
the studio simply could not schedule thing the way they would like — they have to work around the star ' schedule .
wu peizhen catch she cousin in a lie .
" do not you tell we that you be always run into all these big name star at the studio every day ? " she protest .
wang qiyao take pity on the cousin and try to smooth thing over .
" it be get dark .
we have better come back some other time .
we parent will be worry ! "
as the cousin lead they toward the exit they once again run into the director .
not only do he remember they , he address they jocularly as " the girl from so-and-so middle school " — wang qiyao and wu peizhen turn a bright red .
on the ride home , neither be in the mood to talk and they sit silently , listen to the ringing bell of the trolley .
the trolley be half empty ; the after-work rush hour be over and shanghai 's nightlife have yet to begin .
the girl ' experience at the film studio be not exactly as expect ; it be difficult to say whether it be disappointing or whether they have have the time of they life — the one thing for sure be that they be both exhaust .
wu peizhen have never have she sight set on the studio .
she reason for go rest entirely in make wang qiyao happy , so naturally she have hope it would be a wonderful trip .
just what be so wonderful about the film studio , however , wu peizhen have not the slightest clue — she have to wait for wang qiyao 's reaction to find out .
the impression the film studio leave on wang qiyao , on the other hand , be much more complicated .
it be not nearly as magical a place as she have imagine , yet because it appear so ordinary it give she the impression that it be within she grasp — but just what be it that she could grasp ?
she have yet to figure that out .
she initial hope may have be dampen , but the anxiety that come with anticipation have be relieve .
in the day follow they visit to the film studio , wang qiyao do not utter a single word about they trip , and this leave wu peizhen quite depress .
she be afraid that wang qiyao have not like the studio and the whole trip have be a complete waste .
then one day she tell wang qiyao in a confessional tone that she cousin have invite they back to the film studio but she have already decline the offer .
wang qiyao round on she .
" how could you do that ?
he be try to be nice to we ! "
wu peizhen 's eye widen in disbelief .
wang qiyao feel a bit uncomfortable under she stare .
turn she face away , she say , " what i mean be , you should show the guy some respect .
after all , he be you cousin ! "
this be one occasion when even wu peizhen see through wang qiyao .
but far from belittle she friend for be phony , wu peizhen feel a tenderness well up in she heart .
although on the outside she look like a grownup , deep down she be still a child !
wu peizhen think to herself .
at that moment , she feeling for wang qiyao approach maternal love — a love that encompass all .
from then on the film studio become a place for frequent visit .
they learn quite a few inside secret about filmmaking .
they learn that movie be never shoot in sequence , but be make one scene at a time and only edit together in the final stage .
the set location may have be dilapidated and in disrepair , but the image capture by the camera be always perfectly beautiful .
on one or two occasion they actually see some of those famous movie star , who sit in front of the camera do nothing , like a collection of idle prop .
film script be revise at random , and in the blink of a eye even the dead could come back to life .
the girl make they way backstage , and as they rub they hand against the mysterious machinery that make image come to life , they heart seem to undergo a kind of transformation .
time spend in a film studio be never humdrum ; the experience always hint at life 's greater meaning .
this be especially true for the young , who can not yet completely distinguish truth from fiction and the real from the make-believe , and especially during that era — when movie have already become a important part of we everyday life .
camera
wang qiyao have learn that the most critical moment in make a film come the second that the director call , " camera . "
everything up to that point boil down to preparation and foreshadowing , but what happen afterward ?
it end forever .
she come to understand the significance of the word " camera " : it announce a kind of climax .
sometimes the director let they look through the camera and what they see through its lens be always gorgeous ; the camera have the power to filter out all of the chaos and disarray .
it have the power to make what be dark and dismal glimmer with light .
inside the camera be a different world .
after editing and postproduction , only the pure essence would remain .
the director become quite close with the girl and they eventually stop blush in he presence .
a few time , when wu peizhen 's cousin be not in the studio , they even go straight to look for the director .
he have give they the nickname " zhen zhen " and " yao yao , " as if they be character in he latest movie .
behind they back he describe zhen zhen to he colleague as a graceless servant girl right out of dream of the red chamber , a little cleaning maid who think she be special just because she be employ in a large , wealthy household .
yao yao he describe as a proper miss who act the part of a rich official 's daughter , like the tragic lover zhu yingtai .
he treat wu peizhen as if she be a child ; he love to tease she and play little joke on she .
he promise to put wang qiyao in a scene in one of he movie as soon as the opportunity arise .
who know ?
because she coquettish eye resemble ruan lingyu 's , they might even be able to capitalize on the audience 's nostalgia for the dead movie star and make wang qiyao into a new diva of the screen .
although he seem to be kidding , this be the director 's reserved and humorous way of make a promise .
wang qiyao naturally do not take he too seriously , but she do kind of like be compare to ruan lingyu .
then one day the director telephone wang qiyao at home to have she come down to the studio for a screen test .
wang qiyao 's heart race and she hand grow clammy .
she be unsure if this be the opportunity she have be wait for .
she wonder : could my big chance really come this easily ?
she could not believe it , neither do she dare not to believe it .
deep down she heart be in knot .
at first she do not want to tell wu peizhen about it .
she plan to sneak off alone and return before anyone notice that she be go .
in case nothing come of the screen test , it would be she own little secret and she could pretend that nothing have ever happen .
but then , just before the day of she screen test , she break down and ask wu peizhen to go with she so that she would not be too nervous .
wang qiyao do not sleep well the night before ; she face appear thinner than usual and she have dark ring around she eye .
wu peizhen naturally jump for joy as all kind of wild idea go fly through she head .
in no time she be talk about organize press conference for wang qiyao , who regret tell she friend about the screen test .
neither of they pay attention during they class that afternoon .
when school finally let out the two rush out of the gate and hop onto the trolley car .
most of the passenger at that time of the day be housewife with cloth bag in hand , wear wrinkled cheongsam , the seam of they stocking run crookedly up the back of they leg .
they either have messy , disheveled hair or , if they have just walk out of the beauty salon , hair that look like a helmet .
they face be rigid , as if nothing in the world concern they .
even the trolley seem to be afflict with a air of apathy as it rattle along the track .
amid this sea of indifference , wang qiyao and wu peizhen be animated and alive .
though neither say a word , century of anticipation and excitement be brew inside they .
at three o'clock in the afternoon , the shanghai boulevard be suffuse with weariness , prepare to sign out and change shift .
the sun hang in the western sky above the apartment building , glowing ripe and golden .
they heart be fill with anticipation as if they be about to begin a brand-new day .
the director lead they into the dress room and have a makeup artist work on wang qiyao .
see herself reflect in the mirror , wang qiyao could not help feeling that she face be small and she feature plain — she realize that a miracle would not occur — and this depress she .
she become completely resign as the makeup man work on she .
she even close she eye for a while to avoid look in the mirror , uncomfortable and anxious only to get everything over and do with .
she even get neurotic and think that the makeup man , impatient to get finish with she , be apply the makeup hurriedly and crudely .
when she open she eye once again and look , she see the awkward expression of someone who have no desire to be there .
the harsh , unmodulated light of the dress room make everything appear commonplace .
lose all confidence in herself , wang qiyao decide to simply let everything ride ; she focus on watch the makeup man gradually transform she into someone else — a stranger she do not recognize .
it be then that she begin to calm down and she tension ease .
by the time the makeup man finish he job , she have even start to regain she sense of humor and joke around a bit with wu peizhen , who remark that wang qiyao look like the lady in the moon descend into the secular world , whereupon wang qiyao quip that if she be a lady in the moon , she be the kind whose image be find on box of mooncake .
the two of they have a good laugh .
once this happen , wang qiyao 's expression relax , she powdered face light up , and she come to life .
as she return the gaze of the beauty in the mirror , the image she see no longer seem quite as distant and unrecognizable .
before long the director send someone over to escort wang qiyao to the set , wu peizhen naturally follow close behind .
the light be already set up and wu peizhen 's cousin be up on the scaffolding , smile down at they .
the director , on the other hand , become serious and cold , as if he do not even know they .
he have wang qiyao sit on a bed .
it be a nanjing-style bed with ornate flower pattern carve into the woodwork , a mirror set into the headboard , and high bed curtain all around — all the sign of rustic elegance .
wang qiyao be to play a bride in a traditional wedding ceremony .
she would be wear a crimson bridal veil over she head when the groom enter and he would pull it away , slowly reveal she face .
the director explain that she character have to be bashful and charming , fill with longing and uncertainty ; he unloaded these adjective on she all at once , expect she to capture they all with a single expression .
wang qiyao nod , but deep down she be completely lose and have no idea where to begin .
but have decide to let everything ride , she be actually quite calm and compose .
she be aware of everything go on around she , down to the shout of " camera " come from the adjacent set .
the next thing she know , a crimson bridal veil come down over she head .
suddenly everything be swathe in darkness .
in that instant she heart begin pound like a drum .
she understand that she moment have come and fear well up inside she as she knee begin to tremble faintly .
the set light come on , transform the darkness into a thick crimson hue .
suddenly she feel feverish , and the tremor work they way from she knee up through she body .
even she tooth begin to chatter .
all the mystery and grandeur of the film studio hang suspend in the light shimmering outside she veil .
someone come and straighten out she clothing and then quickly walk off set .
the air whisk against she as he pass by .
the crimson veil flutter a bit , for a moment soften the anxiety of that afternoon .
she hear a series of " okay " s repeat in rhythmic succession around she , as if converge upon a common target .
finally come the word , " camera . "
wang qiyao 's breathing stop .
she could not catch she breath .
she could hear the film run through the camera , a mechanical sound that seem to override everything .
she mind just go blank .
when a hand pull away she wedding veil , she be so startle that she shrink back with fright .
" cut , " the director yell .
the set light go dim , the crimson veil go back over she head , and they take it once more from the top .
as they redo the scene , everything grow fuzzy .
thing fade off into the distance , never to reappear , as if they have be a illusion .
then wang qiyao snap out of she daze , she shiver cease , and she heart rate return to normal .
she eye adjust to the darkness once more and through the wedding veil she could make out silhouette of people move around .
the set light come up and this time the shout of " ok " sound perfunctory .
when the word " camera " be call out , it too seem little more than a formality — but this formality still carry with it a air of authority , of unwavering power .
she begin to prepare the emotion the director want to see on she face ; the only problem be that she have no inkling of how to act bashful or charming , or what it mean to be fill with longing and uncertainty .
human emotion be not simple symbol that can be call up at will .
the crimson wedding veil be lift to reveal a rigid expression ; even the bit of natural charm that she normally have about she be freeze .
as soon as he see she through the eye of the camera , the director sense that he have make a mistake ; wang qiyao 's be not a artistic beauty , but quite ordinary .
it be the kind of beauty to be admire in by close friend and relative in she own living room , like the shift mood of everyday life ; a retrain beauty , it be not the kind that make wave .
it be real , not dramatic — the kind of beauty that people notice on the street and photo studio display in they front window .
through the camera 's lens , it be simply too bland .
the director be disappointed , but he disappointment be partly for wang qiyao 's sake .
she beauty will be bury and lose to the world , he say to himself .
later , in order to make thing up to she , he have a photographer friend of he do a photo shoot for she — but this photo shoot turn into something quite extraordinary .
one of the photo even make it into the inside front cover of shanghai life with the caption , " a proper young lady of shanghai . "
and so that be how the screen test end , just another trifling incident in the life of the film studio .
after that , wang qiyao stop go .
she want to forget the whole affair — that it have ever happen .
but the image of that crimson wedding veil and the dazzling studio light be already imprint in she mind and reappear whenever she close she eye .
there be a strange frisson attach to that scene ; it be the most dramatic moment in wang qiyao 's quiet life .
the moment have come and go in a instant , but it add a dab of melancholic color to she heart .
occasionally , on she way home from school , something would unexpectedly stir up she memory of the screen test .
wang qiyao be sixteen year old at the time , but that one day 's experience leave she with the feeling that she have already be through a lot — she feel much older than sixteen .
she start to avoid wu peizhen , as if the latter have steal some secret from she .
whenever wu peizhen invite she out after school , wang qiyao would almost always find some excuse not to go .
several time wu peizhen even go to wang qiyao 's apartment to look for she , but each time wang qiyao have the maidservant say that she be not home .
sense that she be be avoid , wu peizhen feel heartbroken , but she hold on to the hope that wang qiyao would eventually come back to she .
she friendship change into a kind of pious waiting ; she do not even look for any new girlfriend , afraid that they might take wang qiyao 's place .
wu peizhen have a faint notion that the reason wang qiyao be avoid she have something to do with that fail screen test , so she too stop go to the film studio , even break off contact with she cousin .
the screen test become a source of sorrow for both of they , leave they with a deep sense of defeat .
thing gradually get to the point where they be no longer on speak term : run into one another at school , each would make haste to awkwardly get out of the other 's way .
they sit on opposite side of the classroom , but , though they eye never meet , they could always feel one another 's ' presence .
a wall of pity grow between they .
the incident at the film studio end with the word " camera , " and the result be what they call in the industry a " freeze frame . "
go , never to return , but the memory hang on for all eternity .
they after-school life gradually return to normal ; but thing be not really the same — something have be snatch away .
they be hurt , but neither could say where the pain be .
at they girl ' school , where rumor usually fly rampant , not a soul know about wang qiyao 's screen test ; they have succeed in keep it completely under wrap .
it be implicitly understand between they that they should never broach the subject .
actually , just to be choose by a director for a screen test would already have be a great honor in the eye of most girl — any hope of get a part would be a long shot in a long shot .
this be also what wang qiyao think at first , but once she reach that stage everything change .
suddenly , a price have be exact and loss be imminent .
only because wu peizhen step out of she own shoe and empathize completely with she friend be she able to understand the grief wang qiyao be go through .
