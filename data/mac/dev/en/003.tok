qin-shus be surprise to hear bao-yu call out she childhood name in he sleep , but do not like to pursue the matter .
as she stand wonder , bao-yu , who be still bemused after he dream and not yet in full possession of he faculty , get out of bed and begin to stretch himself and to adjust he clothes , assist by aroma .
as she be do up he trousers , she hand , chance to stray over he thigh , come into contact with something cold and sticky which cause she to draw it back in alarm and ask he if he be all right .
instead of answering , he merely redden and give the hand a squeeze .
aroma have always be a intelligent girl .
she be , in any case , a year or two older than bao-yu and have recently begin to have some understanding of the fact of life .
observe the condition that bao-yu be in , she therefore have more than a inkling of what have happen .
abandon she question , she busy herself with he clothes , she cheek suffuse by a crimson blush of embarrassment .
when he be properly dress , they go to rejoin grandmother jia and the rest .
there they bolt a hurry supper and then slip back to the other house , where aroma profit from the absence of the nurse and the other maid to take out a clean undergarment for bao-yu to change into .
' please , aroma , ' bao-yu shamefacedly entreat as she help he change , ' please do not tell anyone ! '
equally ill at ease , aroma giggle softly .
' why do you ... ? ' she begin to ask .
then , after glance cautiously around , begin again .
' where do that stuff come from ? '
bao-yu blush furiously and say nothing .
aroma stare at he curiously and continue to giggle .
after much hesitation he proceed to give she a detailed account of he dream .
but when he come to the part of it in which he make love to two-in-one , aroma throw herself forward with a shriek of laughter and bury she face in she hand .
bao-yu have long be attract by aroma 's somewhat coquettish charm and tug at she purposefully , anxious to share with she the lesson he have learn from disenchantment .
aroma know that when grandmother jia give she to bao-yu she have intend she to belong to he in the fullest possible sense , and so , have no good reason for refuse he , she allow he , after a certain amount of coy resistance , to have he way with she .
from then on bao-yu treat aroma with even greater consideration than before , whilst aroma for she part redouble the devotion with which she serve he .
but of this , for the time be , no more .
the inhabitant of the rong mansion , if we include all of they from the highest to the humblest in we total , number more than three hundred soul , who produce between they a dozen or more incident in a single day .
face with so exuberant a abundance of material , what principle should you chronicler adopt to guide he in he selection of incident to record ?
as we ponder the problem where to begin , it be suddenly solve for we by the appearance as it be out of nowhere of someone from a very humble , very insignificant household who , on the strength of a very tenuous , very remote family connection with the jias , turn up at the rong mansion on the very day of which we be about to write .
they name be wang and they be native of these part .
a grandfather have hold some very small official post in the capital and have there become acquaint with wang xi-feng 's grandfather , the father of lady wang .
conceive a admiration for the power and prestige of this greater namesake , he have seek to link he family with the latter 's clan by become he adoptive nephew .
only lady wang and she elder brother – wang xi-feng 's father – who chance at that time to be stay with they parent on he tour of duty at the capital , know anything about this .
the other member of the clan be unaware that any such relationship exist .
the grandfather have long since die , leave a only son call wang cheng who , have fall on hard time , have move back into the countryside somewhere outside the capital .
wang cheng in he turn have die leave a son call gou-er , who have marry a girl from a family call liu and now have two child , a son call ban-er and a daughter call qing-er .
the four of they depend on agriculture for they living , and since , with gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and he wife busy about the farm drawing water , pound grain , and the like , there be no one to look after qing-er and she little brother , gou-er invite he mother-in-law , old grannie liu , to come and live with they .
this grannie liu be a ancient widow-woman , rich in experience of the world , who , have no son or daughter-in-law to cherish she , eke out she solitary existence by scratch a livelihood from a miserable half-acre of land .
she therefore embrace she son-in-law 's invitation with alacrity and throw herself enthusiastically into the business of help the young couple to make a living .
the season be now at the turn between autumn and winter .
the cold weather be begin , but none of the preparation for winter have yet be make .
by drink to allay he anxiety , gou-er merely put himself more out of temper .
he return home to vent some of he spleen on he long-suffering wife .
grannie liu could eventually stomach no more of he wife-baiting and intervene on she daughter 's behalf .
' now look here , son-in-law : probably you will think i a interfere old woman ; but we country folk have to be grateful for what be in the pot and cut down we appetite to the same measure .
when you be little you ma and pa could afford to indulge you ; so now you be grown-up you spend all you money as soon as you have get any , without stop to count the cost ; then , when it be all go , you start make a fuss .
but what sort of way be that for a grown man to behave ?
' now where we live may be out in the country , but it be still " in the emperor 's shadow " , as they say .
over there in the city the street be pave with money just wait for someone to go and pick it up .
what be the sense in rampage around here at home when you could go out and help yourself ? '
' it be easy for you to sit on you backside and talk , ' say gou-er rudely , ' but what do you expect i to do ?
go out and rob ? '
' no one 's ask you to rob , ' say grannie liu .
' but can not we all sit down peaceably and think of a way ?
because if we do not , the money be not go to come walk in the door of its own accord . '
gou-er snort sarcastically .
' if there be a way , do you suppose i should have wait till now before try it out ?
there be no tax-collector in my family and no mandarin among my friend .
what way could there be of lay my hand on some money ?
even if i do have rich friend or relation , i be not so sure they would want to be bother with the likes of we . '
' i would not say that , ' say grannie liu .
' man propose , god dispose .
it be up to we to think of something .
we must leave it to the good lord to decide whether he 'll help we or not .
who know , he might give we the opportunity we be look for .
' now i can think of a chance you might try .
you family use to be connect with the wang clan of nanking .
twenty year ago the nanking wangs use to be very good to you folk .
it be only because of late year you have be too stiff-necked to approach they that they have become more distant with you .
' i can remember go to they house once with my daughter .
the elder miss wang be a very straightforward young lady , very easy to get on with , and not at all high and mighty .
she be now the wife of the younger of the two sir jias in the rong mansion .
they say that now she be get on in year she be grow even more charitable and give to good work than she be as a girl .
she brother have be promote ; but i should not be surprise if she at least do not still remember we .
why do not you try you luck with she ?
you never know , she might do something for you for the sake of old time .
she only have to feel well disposed and a hair off she arm would be thicker than a man 's waist to poor folk like we ! '
' that be all very well , mother , ' put in gou-er 's wife , ' but just take a look at we !
what sort of state be we in to go call on great folk like they ?
i doubt the people at the door would bother to tell they we be there .
who be go to all that trouble just to make a fool of themselves ? '
gou-er 's cupidity , however , have be arouse by the word of he mother-in-law , and he reaction to they be less discouraging than he wife 's .
' well , if it be as you say , grannie , and be as you have already see this lady , why not go there yourself and spy out the land for we ? '
' bless we and save we ! ' say grannie liu .
' you know what they say : " a prince 's door be like the deep sea . "
what sort of creature do you take i for ?
the servant there do not know i ; it would be a journey waste . '
' that be no problem , ' say gou-er .
' i 'll tell you what to do .
you take young ban-er with you and ask for old zhou that stay in service with you lady after she marry .
if you tell they you have come to see he , it will give you a excuse for the visit .
old zhou once entrust a bit of business to my father .
he use to be very friendly with we at one time . '
' i know all about that , ' say grannie liu .
' but it be a long time since you have anything to do with he and hard to say how he may prove after all these year .
howsomever .
be a man , you naturally can not go in you present pickle ; and a young married woman like my daughter can not go gallivant around the countryside show herself to everybody .
but as my old face be tough enough to stand a slap or two , it be up to i to go .
so be it , then .
if any good do come of the visit , we shall all of we benefit . '
and so , that very evening , the matter be settle .
next day grannie liu be up before dawn .
as soon as she have wash and do she hair , she set about teaching ban-er a few word to say to the lady at the great house – a exercise to which he submit cheerfully enough , as would any little boy of four or five who have be promise a outing to the great city .
that do , she set off on she journey , and in due course make she way to two dukes street .
there , at each side of the stone lion which flank the gate of the rong mansion , she see a cluster of horse and palanquin .
not daring to go straight up , she first dust down she clothes and rehearse ban-er 's little repertoire of phrase before sidle up to one of the side entrance .
a number of important-looking gentleman sit in the gateway sun they belly and discourse with animated gesture on a wide variety of topic .
grannie liu waddle up to they and offer a respectful salutation .
after look she up and down for a moment or two , they ask she she business .
grannie liu smile ingratiatingly .
' i have come to see old zhou that use to be in service with she ladyship before she marry .
could i trouble one of you gentleman to fetch he out for i ? '
the gentleman ignore she request and return to they discussion .
after she have wait there for some considerable time one of they say , ' if you stand at that gate along there on the corner , someone from inside the house should be come out presently . '
but a more elderly man among they protest that it be ' a shame to send she on a fool 's errand ' , and turn to grannie liu he say , ' old zhou be away in the south at the moment , but he missus be still at home .
she live round at the back .
you 'll have to go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for she there . '
grannie liu thank he and trot off with little ban-er all the way round to the rear entrance .
there she find a number of sweetmeat vendor and toy-seller who have set they wares down outside the gate and be be beseige by a crowd of some twenty or thirty noisy , yell child .
she grab a small urchin from they midst and draw he towards she .
' tell i , sonny , be there a mrs zhou live here ? '
the urchin stare back at she impudently .
' which mrs zhou ?
there be several mrs zhous here .
what be she job ? '
' she be the mrs zhou that come here with she ladyship when she be marry . '
' that be easy , ' say the urchin .
' follow i ! '
he lead grannie liu into a rear courtyard .
' that be where she live , ' he say , point in the direction of a side wall .
then , bawl over the wall , ' mrs zhou , there be a old woman come to see you ! '
zhou rui 's wife come hurry out and ask who it be .
' how be you , my dear ? ' say grannie liu , advance with a smile .
zhou rui 's wife scrutinize she questioningly for some moment before finally recognize she .
' why , it be grannie liu !
how be you ?
it be so many year since i see you last , i would forget all about you !
come in and sit down ! '
grannie liu follow she cackling .
' you know what they say : " important people have short memory . "
i would not expect you to remember the likes of we ! '
when they be indoors , zhou rui 's wife order she little hire help to pour out some tea .
' and have not ban-er grow a big boy ! ' say zhou rui 's wife ; then , after a few inquiry about the various thing that have happen since they last meet , she ask grannie liu about she visit .
' be you just pass by , or have you come specially ? '
' well , of course , first and foremost we come to see you , ' reply grannie liu mendaciously , ' but we be also hope to pay we respects to she ladyship .
if you could take we to see she , that would be very nice ; but if that be not possible , perhaps we could trouble you just to give she we regard . '
from the tone of this reply zhou rui 's wife be already able to make a pretty good guess as to the real purpose of the old woman 's visit ; but because some year previously she husband have receive a lot of help from gou-er 's father in a dispute over the purchase of some land , she could not very well reject grannie liu now , when she come to she as a suppliant .
she be , in any case , anxious to demonstrate she own importance in the jia household ; and so the answer she give she be a gracious one .
' do not you worry , grannie !
after you have make such a long pilgrimage , we will not let you go home without see a real buddha !
by rights , of course , callers and visitors have nothing to do with i .
you see , we each have we own job here .
my man 's be collect the half-yearly rent in the spring and autumn ; and when he be not do that , he take the young master out when they go on visit .
that be all he ever do .
now my job be to attend to they ladyship and the young mistress when they go out .
but be as how you be a relation of she ladyship , and since you have put you confidence in i and turn to i to help you , i do not mind break the rule for once and take in a message .
' there be only one thing , though .
i do not expect you know , but thing here be very different from what they be five year ago .
nowadays she ladyship do not run thing here any longer .
it be master lian 's wife who do all the managing –
you 'll never guess who that be :
she ladyship 's niece wang xi-feng .
you know , she ladyship 's eldest brother 's daughter , that we use to call " feng-ge " when she be a child . '
' bless you , my dear , for be such a help ! ' say grannie liu .
' oh grannie , how can you say such a thing ? ' say zhou rui 's wife demurely .
' you know what the old saying be , " he who help other help himself . "
it be only a question of say a few word .
no trouble at all . '
so say , she instruct the little maid to slip quietly round to the back of old lady jia 's quarter and ask if they be serve lunch yet .
the little maid depart on she errand and the two woman resume they conversation .
' this mrs lian , ' say grannie liu : ' she can not be more than eighteen or nineteen year old .
she must be a very capable young woman .
fancy she being able to run a great household like this ! '
' oh grannie , you have no idea ! ' say zhou rui 's wife .
' mrs lian may be young , but when it come to do thing , she be get a older head on she shoulder than any i have ever come across .
she be grow up to be a real beauty too , have mrs lian .
but sharp !
well , if it ever come to a slanging match , she can talk down ten grown man any day of the week !
wait till you meet she , and you 'll see what i mean .
there be only one thing , though .
she be a bit too strict with those beneath she . '
as she be speak , the little maid come back , she errand complete .
' they have finish serve lunch at she old ladyship 's .
mrs lian be still there . '
zhou rui 's wife hurriedly rise to she foot and urge grannie liu to do likewise .
' quick !
after she come out from there she 'll be free for a few minute while she have she meal .
we must try and catch she then .
if we delay a moment longer , people will start come in with message and we sha not have a chance to speak to she .
and once she go off for she afternoon nap , we have really lose she ! '
grannie liu get off the kang , adjust she clothing , conduct ban-er through a rapid revision of he little stock of phrase and follow zhou rui 's wife through various twist and turn to jia lian 's quarter .
just before they reach they , zhou rui 's wife plant they both in a covered passage-way while she go on ahead round the screen wall and into the gate of the courtyard .
first ascertain that wang xi-feng have not yet leave lady jia 's , she seek out xi-feng 's chambermaid and principal confidante , patience , and prime she with a full account of grannie liu 's antecedent .
' she have come all this way today to pay she respects , ' she conclude .
' at one time she ladyship use to see quite a lot of she , which be why i think it would be in order for i to bring she in .
i think i would wait for the young mistress to come back and explain it all to she .
i hope she will not be angry with i for push myself forward . '
patience at once make up she mind what to do .
' let they come in here .
they can sit here while they be wait . '
zhou rui 's wife go off again to fetch she charge .
as they ascend the step to the main reception room , a little maid lift up the red carpet which serve as a portiere for they to enter .
a strange , delicious fragrance seem to reach forward and enfold they as they enter , produce in grannie liu the momentary sensation that she have be transport bodily to one of the celestial paradise .
they eye , too , be dazzle by the bright and glittering thing that fill the room .
temporarily speechless with wonder , grannie liu stand wag she head , alternate click of admiration with pious ejaculation .
from the glitter reception room they pass to a room on the east side of it in which jia lian 's baby daughter sleep .
patience , who be stand by the edge of the kang , make a rapid assessment of grannie liu and judge it sufficient to greet she with a civil ' how-do-you-do ' and a invitation to be seat .
grannie liu look at the silk and satin in which patience be dress , the gold and silver ornament in she hair , she beauty of feature which in every respect correspond with what she have be tell of wang xi-feng , and take the maid for the mistress , be on the point of greet she as ' gou-er 's aunt ' , when zhou rui 's wife introduce she as ' miss patience ' .
then , when patience shortly afterwards address zhou rui 's wife as ' mrs zhou ' , she know that this be no mistress but a very high-class maid .
so grannie liu and ban-er get up on the kang at one side , while patience and zhou rui 's wife sit near the edge of it on the other , and a little maid come in and pour they all some tea .
grannie liu 's attention be distract by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike the sound make by a flour-bolting machine , and she could not forbear glance round she from time to time to see where it come from .
presently she catch sight of a sort of boxlike object fasten to one of the central pillar of the room , and a thing like the weight of a steelyard hang down from it , which swing to and fro in ceaseless motion and appear to be the source of the noise which have distract she .
' i wonder what that can be , ' she think to herself , ' and what it can be use for ? '
as she study the strange box , it suddenly give forth a loud dong ! like the sound of a bronze bell or a copper chime , which so startle the old lady that she eye nearly pop out of she head .
the dong ! be follow in rapid succession by eight or nine other , and grannie liu be on the point of ask what it mean , when all the maid in the house begin scurry about shout , ' the mistress !
the mistress !
she 'll be come out now ! ' and patience and zhou rui 's wife hurriedly rise to they foot .
' just stay here , grannie , ' they say .
' when it be time for you to see she , we shall come in and fetch you ' ; and they go off with the other servant to greet they mistress .
as grannie liu sit in silence , wait with bated breath and head cock to one side for she summons , she hear a far-off sound of laughter , follow presently by a sound of rustling dress as between ten and twenty woman enter the reception room and pass from it into the room beyond .
then two or three woman bear large red lacquer box take up they position on the side nearest the room in which she sit and stand there wait to be call .
a voice in the far room call out , ' serve now , please ! ' at which , to judge from the noise , most of the woman scuttle off , leave only the few who be wait at table .
a long silence ensue in which not so much as a cheep could be hear ; then two woman come in bear a small , low table which they set down on the kang .
it be cover with bowl and dish contain all kind of meat and fish , only one or two of which appear to have be touch .
at the sight of it ban-er set up a clamour for some meat and be silence by grannie liu with a resounding slap .
just at that moment zhou rui 's wife appear , she face all wreathe in smile , and advance towards grannie liu beckon .
grannie liu slip off the kang , lift down ban-er , and exchange a few hurry whisper with she in the reception room before waddle into the room beyond .
a dark-red pattern curtain hang from brass hook over the doorway .
inside , under the window in the south wall , there be a kang cover with a dark-red carpet .
at the east end of the kang , up against the wooden partition wall , be a backrest and bolster , both cover in gold brocade , and a large flat cushion for sit on , also glitter with gold thread .
beside they stand a silver spittoon .
wang xi-feng have on a little cap of red sable , which she wear about the house for warmth , fasten on with a pearl-studded bandeau .
she be dress in a sprigged peach-pink gown , with a ermine-lined skirt of dark-red foreign crepe underneath it , and a cloak of slate-blue silk with weave coloured inset and lining of grey squirrel around she shoulder .
she face be exquisitely made-up .
she be sit on the edge of the kang , she back straight as a ramrod , with a diminutive pair of tong in she hand , remove the spend charcoal from a portable hand-warmer .
patience stand beside she carry a covered teacup on a tiny inlaid lacquer tray .
xi-feng appear not to have notice she , for she neither reach out for the cup nor raise she head , but continue pick ab-sorbedly at she hand-warmer .
at last she speak : ' why not ask they in , then ? '
as she do so , she raise she head and see zhou rui 's wife with she two charge already stand in front of she .
she make a confused movement as if to rise to she foot , welcome the old lady with a look of unutterable benevolence , and almost in the same breath say rather crossly to zhou rui 's wife , ' why do not you tell i ? '
by this time grannie liu be already down on she knee and have touch she head several time to the floor in reverence to she ' aunt feng ' .
' stop she , zhou dear ! ' say xi-feng in alarm .
' she must not do that ,
i be much too young !
in any case , i do not know she very well .
i do not know what sort of relation we be and what i should call she . '
' this be the grannie liu i be just tell you about , ' say zhou rui 's wife .
xi-feng nod , and grannie liu sit herself down on the edge of the kang .
ban-er at once hide himself behind she back and neither threat nor blandishments would induce he to come out and make a bow to he ' auntie ' .
' relation do not come to see we much nowadays , ' say xi-feng affably .
' we be get to be quite stranger with everybody .
people who know we realize that it be because you be tire of we that you do not visit we oftener ; but some spiteful people who do not know we so well think it be we fault , because we have grow too proud . '
grannie liu invoke the lord buddha in pious disavowal of so shocking a view .
' it be hard time that keep we away .
we can not afford to visit .
we be afraid that if we come to see you look the way we be , you would disown we ; and even the people at the gate might think we be tramp ! '
' now you be really be too hard on we !
what if grandfather do make a little bit of a name for himself and we do hold some miserable little appointment ?
what do it all amount to ?
it be all empty show , really .
you know what they say : " even the emperor have poor relation . "
it would be strange indeed if we do not have a few ! '
she turn to zhou rui 's wife .
' have you tell she ladyship yet ? '
' no , ma'am .
i be wait for you instruction . '
' go and have a look , then .
if she have anyone with she , you have better leave it ; but if she be free , tell she about they visit and see what she say . '
zhou rui 's wife depart on she errand .
xi-feng tell one of the servant to give ban-er a handful of sweet , and have just begin a desultory conversation with grannie liu when a number of domestic and underling of either sex arrive to report on they duty .
' i be entertain a guest , ' say xi-feng to patience when she come in to announce they arrival .
' let they leave it until this evening .
but if anyone have important business , bring they in and i will deal with it now . '
patience go out and return a minute later to say that she have ask they and no one have any business of special importance , so she have send they all away .
xi-feng nod .
at this point zhou rui 's wife return with a message for xi-feng .
' she ladyship say she be not free today , but that if you will entertain they for she , it will be just the same as if she be to receive they herself .
she say please thank they very much for come .
and she say if it be just a ordinary visit she have nothing more to add ; but if they have anything particular to say , she say tell they that they can say it to you instead . '
' i have not anything particular in mind , ' say grannie liu .
' only to look in on she ladyship and you mistress .
just a visit to relation . '
' well all right then , if you be sure you have nothing to say .
but if you have get anything to say , you really ought to tell the mistress .
it will be just the same as if you be to say it to she ladyship . '
zhou rui 's wife dart a meaningful look at grannie liu as she say this .
grannie liu perfectly well understand the significance of this look , and a blush of shame overspread she face .
yet if she do not speak up now , what would have be the purpose of she visit ?
she force herself to say something .
' by rights i ought not to mention it today , see that this be we first meeting : but as i have come such a long way to see you , it seem silly not to speak ... '
she have get no further when the page from the outer gate announce the arrival of ' the young master from the ning mansion ' and xi-feng gesture to she to stop .
' it be all right .
there be no need to tell i . '
she turn to the page .
' where be master rong , then ? '
a man 's footstep sound outside and a fresh-faced , willowy youth of seventeen or eighteen in elegant and expensive-looking winter dress come into the room .
grannie liu , acutely embarrass in this male presence , do not know whether to sit or stand , and look round she in vain for somewhere to hide herself .
xi-feng laugh at she discomfiture .
' do not mind he ; just stay where you be !
it be only my nephew . '
with a good deal of girlish simpering grannie liu sit down again , perch herself obliquely on the extreme edge of the kang .
jia rong salute he aunt manchu fashion .
' my father be entertain a important visitor tomorrow and he wonder if he might borrow the little glass screen that you uncle wang 's wife give you , to put on we kang while he be there .
we can let you have it back again as soon as he have go . '
' you be too late , ' say xi-feng .
' i lend it yesterday to someone else . '
jia rong flash a win smile at she and half-knelt on the side of the kang .
' if you will not lend it , my father will say that i do not ask properly and i shall get a beating .
come on , auntie , be a sport !
just for my sake ! '
xi-feng smile maliciously .
' i do not know what be so special about my family 's thing .
heaven know , you have enough stuff of you own over there ; yet you have only to set eye on anything of ours , and you want it for yourselve . '
jia rong 's smile flash again .
' please , auntie !
be merciful ! '
' if it be the tiniest bit chip , ' say xi-feng , ' i 'll have the hide off you ! '
she order patience to take the key of the upstairs room and get some reliable servant to carry it over .
delighted with he good luck , jia rong hurriedly forestall she .
' i 'll get some of my own people to carry it .
do not put yours to a lot of trouble ! ' and he hurry out .
xi-feng suddenly seem to remember something , and call to he through the window , ' rong , come back ! '
servant in the yard outside dutifully take up the cry , ' master rong , you be want back again ! '
jia rong come hurry back , wreathe in smile , and look at xi-feng with eyebrow arched inquiringly .
xi-feng , however , sip very intently from she teacup and muse for a while , say nothing .
suddenly she face flush and she give a little laugh : ' it do not matter .
come back again after supper .
i have get company now , and besides , i do not feel in the mood to tell you . '
' yes , aunt , ' say jia rong , and purse he lip up in a complacent smile he saunter slowly out of the room .
have all this while have time to collect herself , grannie liu begin she speech again :
' the real reason i have bring you little nephew here today be because he pa and ma have not anything in the house to eat , and the weather be get colder , and – and – i think i would bring he here to see you ... '
she give ban-er a despairing push .
' what do you pa tell you to say when we get here ?
what be it he send we for ?
look at you !
all you can do be sit there eat sweet ! '
it be abundantly clear to xi-feng that the old lady be too embarrassed to go on , and she put she out of she misery with a gracious smile .
' it be quite all right .
there be no need to tell i .
i quite understand . '
she turn to zhou rui 's wife .
' i wonder if grannie have eat yet today ? '
' we be on we way first thing this morning , ' grannie liu chime in .
' there be no time to think about eating . '
xi-feng give order for a meal to be bring in , and zhou rui 's wife go out and presently reappear with a guest 's portion of various choice dish on a little table , which she set down in the east wing , and to which she then conduct grannie liu and ban-er for they meal .
' zhou , dear , ' say xi-feng , ' will you keep they company and see that they have enough to eat ?
i sha not be able to sit with they myself . '
then call she aside for a moment she ask , ' what do she ladyship say when you go to report about they just now ? '
' she say they do not really belong to the family but be adopt into the clan year ago when you grandfather and theirs be work in the same office .
she say they have not be round much of late year , but in the old day when they use to visit we we never send they back empty-handed .
she say it be nice of they to come and see we today and we should be careful to treat they considerately .
and she say if they appear to want anything , she would leave it to you to decide what we should do for they . '
' no wonder ! ' exclaim xi-feng when she have hear this account .
' i could not understand how they could be really related to we if i have never even hear of they . '
while they be talk , grannie liu come back from the other room have already finish eating , smack she lip and suck she tooth appreciatively , and voice she thanks for the repast .
' sit down , ' say xi-feng with a smile .
' i have something to say to you .
i quite understand what you be try to tell i just now .
as we be relation , we ought by rights not to wait for you to come to we door before help you when you be in trouble ; but there be so many thing to attend to in this family , and now that she ladyship be get on a bit she do not always remember they all .
and since i take over the management of the household , i find there be quite a lot of relation that i do not even know about .
and then again , of course , though we may look thrive enough from the outside , people do not realize that be a big establishment like ours carry its own difficulty .
they will not believe it if you tell they , but it be true .
however , since you have come such a long way , and since this be the first time you have ever say a word about need help , we obviously can not let you go back empty-handed .
fortunately it so happen that i still have not touch any of the twenty tael of silver that she ladyship give i the other day to make clothes for the maid with .
if you do not mind it be so little , you be very welcome to take it . '
when grannie liu hear xi-feng talk about ' difficulty ' she conclude that there be no hope .
she delight and the way in which she face light up with pleasure when she hear that she be , after all , to be give twenty tael of silver can be imagine .
' we know you have you trouble , ' she say , ' but as the say go , " a starve camel be bigger than a fat horse . "
say what you like , a hair pluck from you arm be thicker than a man 's waist to folk like we ! '
horrify by the crudity of these expression , zhou rui 's wife , who be stand by , be meanwhile signalling frantically to the old lady to stop .
but xi-feng laugh quite unconcernedly and tell patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it .
the money be set down in front of grannie liu .
' here be the twenty tael of silver , ' say xi-feng .
' take this for the time be to make some winter clothes for the child with .
some time later on , when you have nothing better to do , look in on we for a day or two for kinship 's sake .
it be late now , so i will not try to keep you .
give we regard to everybody who ought to be remember when you get back ! '
she rise to she foot , and grannie liu , with heartfelt expression of gratitude , pick up the money and follow zhou rui 's wife out of the room .
' my dear good woman , ' say the latter when they be out of earshot , ' whatever come over you ?
first , when you meet she , you could not get a word out ; then , when you do start talk , it be all " you nephew " this and " you nephew " that !
i hope you will not mind my say so , but even if the child be a real nephew you would still need to go a bit easy on the familiarity .
now master rong , he be she real nephew .
that be the sort of person a lady like that call " nephew " .
where she would come by a nephew like this one , i just do not know ! '
' my dear , ' reply grannie liu with a laugh , ' when i see the pretty little darling sit there , i take such a liking to she that my heart be too full to speak . '
back in zhou rui 's quarter the two woman sit talk for a while .
grannie liu want to leave a piece of silver to buy something for the zhou child with , but zhou rui 's wife say she would not hear of it and refuse absolutely to accept anything .
and so , with many expression of gratitude , the old lady take she leave and set out once more through the back gate of the mansion .
and if you want to know what happen after she have leave , you will have to read the next chapter .
