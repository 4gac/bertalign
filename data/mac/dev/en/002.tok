the boot reach the door , and come on into the room .
trinket peep out from behind the table-cloth .
from the size of he footwear , the new arrival seem to be a boy like himself .
he heave a sigh of relief , and put the pancake in he mouth .
he do not dare to take a bite out of it , but soften it with he saliva , and then swallow it silently down .
meanwhile he could hear noisy munch come from the table above he .
the new boy be clearly tuck in .
' why , he be just another scavenger like i ! ' think trinket to himself .
' i 'll jump out and scare he off , then i can carry on eat to my heart 's content . '
he thought run on : ' what a fool i be just now !
i should have stuff a whole plateful in my pocket and bugger off !
this be not like home .
they would not miss a little thing like that , or expect i to pay for it ! '
all of a sudden there be a series of noisy thump .
the new scavenger have start hit something .
he curiosity arouse , trinket poke he head out from under the table .
what he see be a boy of fourteen or fifteen , in a short gown , punch at one of the bag that hang from the beam .
after a while , the boy move across and start attack one of the oxhide cut-out .
he strike the figure first on the chest with one fist , then reach forward with both hand and grapple it by the waist , force it to the ground .
it be very much the same sort of technique as the one use by the manchu wrestler in the inn the previous day .
trinket chuckle to himself and dart out from beneath the table .
' why fight a dummy ! ' he cry .
' why not try i ? '
the other boy 's first reaction be one of alarm , at the sight of this strange apparition with its head swathe in bandage .
but alarm quickly turn to delight when he realize that he have find a spar partner .
' very well ! ' he reply .
' on guard ! '
trinket spring forward and seize the boy 's arm , intend to give he a sharp twist , but the boy turn smartly , and hook he with he right foot , send trinket crash to the floor .
' you be hopeless ! ' he jeer .
' you obviously do not know the first thing about wrestle ! '
' who say i do not ! ' protest trinket , leap to he foot again and reach for the boy 's left leg .
the boy make a grab for he back , but this time trinket dodge in time and the boy seize a handful of air .
trinket recall whisker ' fight with the seven wrestler at the inn , and shoot out a quick left that catch the boy hard , fair and square , on the lower cheek .
the boy stand there stunned for a few seconds , and a momentary look of anger come into he eye .
' you be hopeless ! ' cry trinket with a grin .
' you obviously do not know the first thing about wrestling . '
the boy say nothing , but feint with he left fist .
trinket fall for it and dodge , and as he do so , the boy 's elbow come crash across into he midriff and wind he completely .
he crumple up and fall to the ground in excruciating pain .
the boy now come at trinket from behind , slip both hand under he arm and lace he hand together around he throat , throttle he , and press he harder and harder down on to the ground .
trinket kick frantically with he right foot , but then the boy loose he hand and give he a terrific shove which send he roll across the room like a puppy chase its own tail .
trinket be furious .
he come tumble back , wrap both arm round the boy 's leg , and tug at he with all he might .
the boy crash down right on top of he .
he be quite a bit bigger than trinket , and have soon succeed in throttle he again and pin he to the ground .
trinket begin to choke , thrash out with he foot to extricate himself , and finally manage to wriggle on top of the boy and hold he down .
he be too light to maintain the upper hand for long , however , and soon the boy be back on top of he again .
ever a crafty fighter , trinket now let go of the boy 's leg , get behind he , and land he a good kick on the backside .
the boy quickly grab he right leg and tug at it , send trinket crash down on he back .
the boy leap astride he , pin he head to the floor , and cry : ' well !
surrender ? '
trinket have meanwhile manage to hook he left foot round the boy 's waist , and start to rub it up and down the small of he back .
the boy , it transpire , be extremely ticklish , and he could not help giggling , and loosen he grasp .
trinket seize he chance , leap up , and pin he opponent down by the throat .
the boy now use a standard wrestling ploy , grip trinket by the back of the neck and pull he to the ground with considerable force .
trinket go out like a light .
when he regain consciousness , he find that he be temporarily immobilize .
the boy burst out laughing .
' well ?
have enough ?
give in ? '
but trinket be not finish yet .
he eventually succeed in jump up and land a head-butt right in the boy 's midriff .
the boy groan and stagger back a few step .
trinket lunge after he , the boy lean a little to one side , put out a leg , and bring he tumble to the floor .
trinket reach out frantically as he fall , clutch at the boy 's leg , and the two of they go down together .
they struggle for a while , each one gain the upper hand for a moment , then go under , ring the change more than a dozen time , until finally they be in a complete deadlock , panting and stare fixedly at each other .
and then suddenly , at exactly the same moment , they both burst out laughing .
there be something about the clinch they be in that strike they both as terribly funny .
slowly they let go .
the boy reach out a hand and begin remove the bandage from trinket 's face .
' what do you want to wrap you face up for ? '
trinket be about to snatch the bandage back , when he reflect that the boy have already see most of he face and that it would achieve nothing .
' i do not want anyone to recognize i take the cake . '
' i see , ' say the boy , chuckle and stand up .
' so you make a habit of come here and take food , do you ? '
' no , i do not , ' say trinket .
as he rise to he foot , he steal a closer glance at he opponent : there be something at once impressive and attractive about the boy 's feature , a clearness of brow , a noble look in the eye , a expression in the face , that draw trinket towards he .
' what be you name ? ' ask the boy .
' laurel , ' reply trinket .
' and yours ? '
after a moment 's hesitation the boy reply : ' mine 's . . .
people call i misty .
which of the goong-goong do you work for ? '
' i be with haus goong-goong . '
misty nod , and use trinket 's bandage to mop the sweat from he brow .
he help himself to a cake .
trinket be not go to be outdo .
if this young fellow could continue calmly scavenging , so could he .
he pop another slice of layer cake nonchalantly into he mouth .
' i can see you have never do any wrestling , ' laugh misty .
' but you be a quick mover all the same !
you manage to get away that time .
a few more go and i would have have you , though — '
' be that right ? ' protest trinket .
' come on then : let 's see — '
' at you ! '
the two of they set to again .
misty clearly know a few wrestling move , and be the older and stronger of the two .
but trinket have the benefit of year of experience in the street of yangzhou , where he would have to deal with all manner of bully and thug , big and small , and in this respect he be definitely misty 's superior .
but for one reason or another ( partly whiskers ' lecture , partly because this be , after all , only ' play-fight ' and not in deadly earnest ) he do not avail himself of a single one of the dubious trick at which he excel : the finger-twist , the pigtail-pull , the throat-bite , the eye-poke , the ear-yank , the grip-o ' - the-ball .
as a result he eventually come off the loser again , with misty sit on he back , and no hope of throw he off .
' surrender ? '
' never ! '
misty burst out laughing and jump up .
trinket go for he again , but this time misty shake he head .
' no more for today !
tomorrow , if you like .
but i do not see the point : you 'll never be able to beat i ! '
trinket be not have this .
he pull a piece of silver from he pocket , about three tael ' worth : ' tomorrow we fight for money !
you would better bring three tael yourself ! '
misty seem somewhat take aback by this but then concur .
' all right .
we fight for money .
i 'll bring my stake .
see you here at noon tomorrow . '
' live or die !
excellent kungfu !
my word be my wand ! ' cry trinket , and misty burst out laughing .
' it certainly be ! '
and with that he leave the room .
trinket help himself to a big handful of cake and stuff they inside he jacket .
then he too leave the room .
as he go , he find himself thinking of whisker ' heroic stand at victory hill : now there be a man !
whisker have pledge he word to fight , and nothing could have stand between he and the fulfilment of that pledge , not the wall of he prison cell , not even he own wound .
how many time trinket have sit listen to the storyteller ' tale , and how many time he would dream of one day be a hero himself — trinket the brave man and true !
now , he would say he would fight , and there could be no go back !
he have pledge he word !
and if he be to be a man of he word , he would have to forget about escape — at least for the time be .
he would have to go back to the old eunuch that evening .
he therefore decide to retrace he step to the room where they have be gamble earlier in the day — and from there he take a direction opposite to the one he have take earlier ( which have lead he deeper and deeper into the mansion ) , follow two covered walkway , vaguely remember one or two shrub he have pass by in the courtyard on the way , and somehow , by hook or by crook , navigate he way back to the old eunuch 's quarter .
as he draw near the entrance , he hear the old fellow cough .
' goong-goong ?
be you feel any better ? '
' better my arse ! ' mutter the eunuch .
' get a move on , will you ! '
trinket hurry over to he .
old hai be sit at a table ( the broken one have be replace ) .
'' how much do you win ? '
' i win a dozen tael , ' reply trinket .
' but i — '
' you what ? ' snap the eunuch .
' i lend they to wu . '
in actual fact he have win twenty and lend twelve to wu : the remain eight he wish to hang on to .
old hai scowl at he .
' what do you want to go lend money to that wu fellow for ?
he do not even work in the upper library , dammit !
you could at least have lend to one of the wen brother ! '
trinket do not follow this at all .
' but they do not ask i for a loan . '
' then you should have find a way to offer one .
have you forget everything i ever tell you ? '
' it be just that . . . what with killing that boy yesterday , i can not seem to think straight , it must have go clean out of my mind .
i ought to have lend the money to one of the wen brother , that be right , i remember now , you tell i . '
old hai humph .
' what be so alarming about kill ?
i suppose you be only a child though , you have never do it before .
now , about the book — i hope you have not forget . '
' the book ? '
old hai humph again .
' have you forget everything ? '
' goong-goong , i. . . i have get this terrible headache . . . and i be so worried about you cough ...
i just can not keep my mind on anything ! '
' very well .
come over here ! '
' yes , goong-goong ! '
trinket walk a few step closer .
' i be go to repeat it for you once more .
forget this time , and i shall kill you . '
' yes , goong-goong ! ' pipe trinket , think to himself , ' just say it once , and i 'll never forget it , not in a hundred year ! '
' listen : you be to win money from the wen brother .
then you be to lend they money , the more the better .
then , after a few day you be to ask they to take you to the upper library .
they 'll have to say yes , if they owe you money .
if they try to fob you off , you tell they that i 'll report they to the chief librarian ;
i 'll tell he they refuse to pay they debt , and ask he to wait for he majesty to — '
' he majesty ? '
' what ? '
' oh . . . nothing . '
' if they ask you why you want to go to the upper library , you say that you be longing for a glimpse of he majesty , so you just want a chance to perform some little errand there .
of course the wen brother will not let you see he majesty ; when they take you , he majesty will not even be in the upper library .
that be when you find a way to steal the book . . . '
something be begin to fall into place in trinket 's mind , with all these reference to ' he majesty ' .
' could this be the palace , the forbidden city itself ! ' he think silently to himself .
' have i be wrong all this time , about it be the number one whore-house in peke ?
aiyeeh ! of course !
that must be it !
these people be all eunuch work for the emperor . . . '
as a boy , trinket have hear people talk about the emperor , the empress , princes and princesses , palace ladies , palace eunuchs , but he have not the faintest idea what these grand being actually look like .
all he know be that the emperor wear a dragon robe .
in yangzhou he would see all sort of play , but the eunuch on stage be never dress anything like old hai , or he new gambling friend wu .
and the stage eunuch always hold those long horsehair fly-whisk , and keep wave they around in the air .
and anyway , he have never understand a word of what they be singing .
so this be what real palace eunuch be like !
' cripes ! ' he cry silently to himself .
that mean i have become a little palace eunuch myself !
i have lose my ball ! '
' do you take in what i say just now ? ' growl old hai .
' yes , goong-goong , yes !
i have get to go to he majesty 's upper library ! '
' and why have you get to go ?
to play ? '
' to steal a book . '
' which book ? '
' i. . . i. . . can not remember . '
' i 'll tell you once more .
and this time , do not forget .
it be a sutra , call the sutra in forty-two sections .
it be very old .
there be several copy of it .
just bring they all to i .
get it ?
now — what be it call ? '
' the sutra in forty-two sections . '
trinket sound very pleased with himself .
' what be you so happy about ? ' snap the old eunuch .
' i be just happy about . . . about remember it the minute you mention it again . '
in actual fact , when old hai have speak of steal a book , trinket 's heart have sink .
the ' steal ' part be no problem ; it be the ' book ' part that present what seem at first like a insurmountable obstacle .
the trouble be that trinket could barely read .
he could not decipher more than a word or two , let alone book title .
then he hear the eunuch say that the book be the sutra in forty-two section , and he heart leap : what the word sutra look like he have not the foggiest notion , but number be something he could read .
so the second part of the title be a walk-over !
be not that sufficient reason to be please ?
' now , ' go on old hai , ' if you go steal book from the upper library , you have get to be very smart , very careful .
if anyone spot you , you be as good as dead .
a hundred time over . '
' i know , ' say trinket .
he suddenly think of something , and add : ' if i do get catch , i would never dream of drag you into it , goong-goong ! '
old hai heave a strangely unconcerned sigh .
' drag i in or drag i out , it be all the same to i . . . '
he have another cough fit , and go on : ' you have do quite well today .
at least you have win something .
what do the other think ?
be they suspicious ? '
trinket chortle .
' oh no , why should they be ? '
he be about to boast , but think better of it .
' well then , do not sit around do nothing .
eat you lunch , and if you have no job to do , go and practise with the dice ! '
' yes , goong-goong ! '
trinket walk across to the dining-table , where bowl and chopstick have be lay , four dish and a soup , all untouched .
' goong-goong , be not you eat ?
let i serve you ! '
' i be not hungry .
you go ahead . '
trinket be delighted , and without bother to fill he bowl with rice , he attack a dish of stewed meat .
the food be cold , but he be hungry , and to he it be indescribably delicious .
' i wonder where they get the food from ?
oh well , i would better not ask too many question , just keep my eye open and pick thing up one at a time .
if this really be the forbidden city , then old wu and the wen brother and little misty must all of they be eunuch .
i wonder what the actual emperor and empress look like ?
i must try and get a look .
then one day when i be back at home , ha ha !
i can tell people who i have see .
just imagine the look on they face !
' i wonder if whisker get out safe ?
they do not say anything about someone get catch when we be gamble . . .
most probably he get away all right . '
when he have finish eating , he go through the motion of practise with the dice so as not to arouse the old eunuch 's suspicion , throw they noisily across the table .
after a while he eyelid begin to feel heavy .
he have not sleep all night .
in minute he be sound asleep .
he sleep till evening , when a junior eunuch bring in they supper .
trinket wait on old hai as he eat a bowl of rice , and then help he to bed .
afterwards he go to lie down on the smaller bed , think to himself : ' tomorrow , whatever else happen , i must win my fight with misty ! '
he lay there , try to remember whisker ' fight with the wrestler in the tavern .
he wish he could remember the detail more clearly .
' if only i would take old whiskers up on he offer !
with he as my teacher i could have learn a thing or two on the way up here , and then i could have put misty in he place — even though he be stronger than i be .
if he get i on the ground again tomorrow , i 'll die of shame !
little white dragon — forget it !
i would never dare show my face among the brother ! '
suddenly a thought occur to he .
' the wrestler be no match for whisker ; but whiskers be no match for old turtle-head — why do not i get he to teach i a few move ? '
he ask the old eunuch at once : ' goong-goong , if you want i to go steal book from the upper library , there be just one problem . '
' what be that ? '
' well , after today 's game , i meet this . . . little eunuch , who stand in my way and ask i to give he some of my winnings .
i would not , so we end up fighting .
that be why i be so late for lunch . '
' he beat you , presumably . '
' he be bigger than i , and stronger .
he say i have get to fight with he every day , until i can beat he .
then he 'll let i off . '
' what be the little fellow 's name ?
which part of the palace be he from ? '
' he be call misty .
i do not know where he be from . '
' you must have be act too pleased with yourself after you win — that be probably what annoy he . '
' i will not let he get away with it !
i be go to fight he tomorrow !
but i just wonder if i can beat he . '
old hai humph .
' you want to wangle some move out of i , do not you ?
the answer 's no , so it be no use try . '
' clever old turtle-head ! ' think trinket , silently cursing to himself .
this little fellow misty , ' he begin again , out loud , ' he be not such a good fighter really .
i would not need to learn much to beat he .
i do not need you to teach i , either .
i have he on the ground today , it be just that he be too strong for i : he manage to buck i off .
tomorrow i 'll get a proper grip on he .
that should fix the little bugger ! '
he have be try so hard all day to keep he language clean .
' if you want to stop he buck you , that be easy ! ' say old hai .
' i do not think it would be hard .
i just get he in a good shoulder grip , then — '
' that be no good !
buck come from the lower back .
you have to knee he on the vital point in the small of he back .
come over here and i 'll show you . '
trinket hop out of bed and be at old hai 's bedside in a trice .
the old eunuch feel around in the small of he back and press lightly .
trinket feel he whole body go limp .
' can you remember that ? '
' yes , i 'll try it out tomorrow .
let 's hope it work . '
' works ?
of course it will work .
it be absolutely foolproof ! '
old hai reach out he hand and press lightly on either side of trinket 's neck .
trinket let out a gasp of pain .
he have a choke sensation in he chest , and could hardly breathe .
' get he on these two point , ' say hai , ' and he 'll have no strength to fight with . '
trinket be please as punch .
' well , that be it then !
tomorrow , i win ! '
trinket go back to bed , and fall asleep dream of misty surrender to the little white dragon !
wu come to fetch he again the follow morning .
it be the wen brother ' turn to be banker .
trinket have soon manage to win over twenty tael off they .
it be a bad day for the bank altogether .
in less than a hour they have to pay out fifty tael , which be all they have .
trinket lend they another twenty , and by the end of the day 's play that be all go too .
all trinket could think about be he appointment with misty .
as soon as the gambling be over , he hurry to the ' cake room ' .
the table be pile high again with good thing to eat , and this time trinket tuck in with a vengeance .
then he hear the flip-ploy of cloth boot again .
he duck under the table , just in case it turn out to be someone other than misty .
' laurel !
laurel ! '
it be misty 's voice call from the doorway .
trinket spring out , and with a big grin on he face , call back : ' live or die ! '
' i live , you die ! ' laugh misty , stride into the room .
trinket notice at once that he be wear a completely new outfit , and could not help feeling jealous .
' huh ! ' he mutter to himself .
' just you wait !
you will not be so pleased when i have make a big rip in that smart gown of yours ! '
he let out a great war cry and throw himself straight into the attack .
' excellent kungfu ! ' cry he opponent , grapple he with both arm , and deliver a swing kick with he left foot .
trinket lose he balance , totter and fall , bring misty down with he .
as trinket roll and spin round , he manage to pin misty face down on the floor .
he remember old hai 's little demonstration , and feel for the vital point in the small of misty 's back .
but he have never do this sort of thing before , and it be hard to find the point at he very first attempt .
misty meanwhile have spin round , grip trinket 's left arm , and twist it back .
' hey ! ' scream trinket , ' that be not fair !
twist my arm like that ! '
that be what wresding 's all about ! ' laugh misty .
' who say it be not fair ! '
trinket take advantage of the fact that misty be busy speaking and momentarily off he guard , to launch a counter-attack .
he bring he head down with all he might on to misty 's back , shoot he right hand under he armpit , and fling he up into the air as hard as he could .
misty go fly over he head and land widus a crash on the ground .
he leap to he foot again , cry : ' so you know the buck antelope too ! '
trinket have never even hear of the antelope .
he would just be improvise and thrash around , and somehow or other have manage to outwit he opponent .
he be pretty chuffed .
' the antelope be nothing ! ' he cry .
' i know plenty more , and they be a lot worse .
you have not see anything yet ! '
' perfect ! ' cry misty in delight .
' go to ! '
trinket engage in a quick moment 's reflection : ' misty have obviously have lesson — that be why he keep get the better of i .
but that be no problem .
all i have to do be watch he move and copy they .
he can throw i a few time — i 'll soon get the hang of it . '
misty start come at he .
trinket lunge back , but it be a feint : misty step aside , let trinket surge on , and chop he on the back with the side of he hand .
trinket be unable to rein himself in , and go crash to the ground .
misty give a great cry of delight , leap forwards , and plant himself astride trinket 's back .
' surrender ? '
' no !
never ! ' protest trinket ,
but when he try to straighten himself up and get to he foot , he feel a sudden numbness in the small of he back .
misty have beat he to it !
he have press on exactly the spot old hai have be try to teach he the previous evening .
after struggle futilely for a moment longer , he finally give up .
' all right ! ' he cry .
this time i surrender ! '
misty laugh and set he free .
as trinket get up , he suddenly shoot out one of he foot .
misty topple over , and trinket punch he in the small of the back .
misty give a cry of pain and bent double .
trinket leap on he from behind and grip he tightly round the throat with both he hand .
misty lose consciousness for a instant , and fall flat on the ground .
trinket hold on and demand triumphantly : ' surrender ? '
misty give a little grunt .
then suddenly he drive he elbow hard into trinket 's rib , and trinket go reel over on to the floor , scream with pain , certain that he must have several broken bone .
misty spin round and sit astride he chest , once more the victor , though this time a winded and exhaust one , pant for breath .
' do . . . you . . . give in ? '
' give in my arse ! ' pant trinket back .
the answer 's no !
a hundred time no !
you be lucky just now , that be all ! '
' then get up ... and fight ! '
trinket stretch and heave with all he might ( what little of it he have leave ) , but he opponent be still astride he ache rib , and he effort be to no avail .
after several more minute of futile struggle , he surrender yet again .
misty rise to he foot .
he arm be sore and limp with exhaustion .
trinket stagger to he foot and take a few totter step across the room .
' tomorrow . . . tomorrow i 'll take you on again . . . and i 'll beat you for sure ! '
misty laugh .
' if we fight a hundred time , you 'll . . . you 'll always lose !
if you have get the gut , come again tomorrow ! '
' you be probably the one who be not get the gut !
i be not afraid .
live or die !
my word be my wand ! '
they have both be quite carry away by the fighting , and neither of they have mention the money , or the bet they have lay .
or to be strictly accurate , misty do not mention it , and since he do not , trinket be more than happy to pretend to have forget .
if he have emerge the victor , it would have be a very different story .
