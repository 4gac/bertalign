It is said that Baoyu said "mouse sperm" in Daiyu's room, Baochai bumped into him, satirizing Baoyu's Lantern Festival not knowing the "green wax" ceremony, and the three were making fun of each other in the room.
Na Baoyu feared that Daiyu would sleep after a meal, temporarily save food, or go sleepy at night, and be in poor health. Fortunately, Baochai came and everyone talked and laughed, and Daiyu didn't want to sleep, so he was relieved.
Suddenly he heard him yell in the room. Everyone listened attentively. Daiyu first laughed and said, "This is your mother and Xiren calling.
It's nothing more than treat him, your mother has to be careful to choke him again, it can be seen that the old back is obscure. "
Baoyu was eager to rush over, Baochai grabbed him and said, "Don't quarrel with your mother!
He is always confused, but what is going to let him go a step further. "
Baoyu said: "I see."
Come here after talking.
I saw Grandma Li, on crutches, scolding people at the local: "Forget this little prostitute!
I lifted you up. I'm here for a while. Your big model is lying on the kang, and I don't care when I see you.
I just want to make up the fox Meizi to coax Baoyu, and the coaxing Baoyu ignores me and only listens to you.
You are just a little girl who bought a few taels of silver, and you will consume it in this room!
Okay, pull it out to match a kid, and see if you are still coaxing people like a fairy! "
The attacker only spoke to Mother Li, but because he was lying down and angry, he rarely argued: "I sweated and covered my head when I was sick. I didn't see your old man."
Later, when I heard him say "Hope Baoyu" and "match the boy", I couldn't help but be ashamed and wronged, and couldn't help crying.
Although Baoyu heard these words, it was not good, she had to argue for him, saying "I'm sick, take medicine", and then said: "If you don't believe me, just ask other girls."
After hearing this, Grandma Li became more angry and said, "You only protect the fox, do you recognize me there?
Tell me who to ask?
Who won't help you?
Who didn't attack the people to take down the horse?
I know all those things!
I only tell you to the old lady and the wife:
You breasted you so big, and now you can’t eat it, so you throw me aside, trying to be strong with the girls! "
Said while crying.
At that time, Daiyu Baochai and others also came to persuade: "Mom, your old man will take care of them and it will be over."
Seeing that the two of them were coming, Grandma Li complained of grievances, and went out to have tea that day, Xixue went out, and talked about things like yesterday's cheese and so on.
But Sister Qiaofeng was going to the room to calculate the winning or losing account. When she heard a scream from behind, she knew that it was Grandma Li's old illness, and it was worth him to lose money today, angering others, and punishing Baoyu's girl.
So he hurried over to pull Grandma Li, and said with a smile: "Mom, don't be angry.
After the big festival, the old lady just liked it for a day.
You are an old man, and when others are noisy, you have to care about them; don't you know the rules and yell here to make the old lady angry?
You say who is not good, I will beat him for you.
The sizzling pheasant burning in my house will soon follow me for a drink. "
On the one hand, while pulling away, he called: "Feng'er, hold a crutch for your grandma Li, and a silk for wiping tears."
The mother Li kept her feet on the ground, and left with Sister Feng, and said:
"I don't want this old fate either. I simply lose the rules today, make a fuss and have no face, as if I was angry with those whores!"
Behind Baochai Daiyu, seeing Sister Feng like this, clapped her hands and laughed:
"Thanks to his gust of wind, he picked up an old woman."
Baoyu nodded and sighed: "I don't know where this is the account, only the soft bullying!
I don't know that it was the girl who had offended, and was put on his account. "
Before the end of the sentence, Qingwen said to the side: "Who is not crazy, and what did he offend?
If you offend him, you have the ability to take on the responsibility, and you can't tire others! "
While Xiren cried, he pulled Baoyu and said:
"You offended an old grandmother for me, and you offended these people for me. This is not enough for me, it's just pulling people!"
Seeing his illness in this way, Baoyu added these worries, and swallowed quickly, comforting him to still sweat while sleeping.
Seeing him hot in the soup again, guarding him by himself, persuading him from the side:
"Just recuperate, don't think about things that don't matter."
Xiren sneered and said, "If you want to be angry about these things, can you live in this room for a moment?
But it's just that for a long time, so much trouble, how can people get along!
You just offend people for me for a while, and they all remember it in their hearts. When encountering hurdles, what they said was easy to say and bad, what do you mean? "
On the one hand, she couldn't help crying, and was afraid of Baoyu's troubles, so she had to endure it.
The old lady who was a messenger brought Erhe medicine.
Baoyu saw that he was a little sweaty, so he didn't ask him to get up, and took it to him and ate it on the pillow, even if the little maids spread the kang.
Xing Ren said: "If you eat or not, the old lady and your wife will sit in front of you for a while, play with the girls for a while, and then come back.
I just lie down quietly. "
Baoyu heard that she had to rely on him and watch him go to the hairpin ring to lie down before going to the room to eat with Mother Jia.
After the meal, Jia's mother still wanted to fight the old butler's mothers.
Baoyu thought about Xiren, so he went back to the room and saw Xiren sleep dimly.
I want to sleep, it's still early.
At that time, Qingwen, Qixia, Qiuwen, and Bihen were all looking for fun, and went to play games with Mandarin Duck and Amber.
See Sheyue alone wipe the dominoes under the lamp in the outer room.
Baoyu smiled and said, "Why don't you go with them?"
She Yue said: "There is no money."
Baoyu said: "There are piles of money under the bed, is it not enough for you to lose?"
She Yue said: "I'm all happy. Who will give this house to?
The other one was sick again. The house was filled with lights above and fire below. Those old ladies were all ‘going to the ground’ and serving for a day, they should also be told to rest.
The little girls also served for a day, isn't this time called for fun?
So I am watching here. "
After Baoyu heard this, he was openly another attacker.
Yin said with a smile: "I'm sitting here, don't worry."
She Yue said: "Since you are here, you don't have to go.
The two of us don't talk well? "
Baoyu said: "What do we two do?
It's boring.
It's fine, you get up early and say your head is itchy, it will be fine for a while, I will grate your head for you. "
She Yue said: "Make it."
With that said, he brought the stationery mirror case, removed the hairpin, and opened his hair. Baoyu took the grate for him.
After only three or five times of grate, seeing Qingwen hurriedly walk in to withdraw money, when he saw two of them, she sneered: "Oh!
Jiao Beizhan'er hadn't eaten it, so he went on his head! "
Baoyu smiled and said, "Come on, I will also grate for you."
Qingwen said: "I'm not so lucky."
With that, I took the money, dropped the curtain, and went out.
Baoyu was behind She Yue, She Yue looked at the mirror, and the two smiled while looking at each other in the mirror.
Baoyu smiled and said, "It's just him grinding his teeth all over the room."
She Yue heard that she hurriedly waved her hand in the mirror.
Baoyu understood, when the curtain rang suddenly, Qingwen ran in and asked, "Why did I grind my teeth?
Let's talk about it! "
She Yue smiled and said, "Fuck you, and quarrel again."
Qingwen also smiled and said: "You are protecting him again!
You guys, I don’t even know if you look at it!
I'll talk about it when I get it back. "
With that said, I went in one go.
Here Baoyu turned his head, and ordered She Yue to quietly wait for him to sleep, and refused to alarm people.
No words for one night.
In the early morning of the next day, the attacker was already sweating at night and felt a little more relaxed. He only ate some rice soup to rest.
Baoyu was relieved, because he walked to Aunt Xue to hang out after dinner.
In the first month of the year, the school room was closed for school, and the thorns were avoided in the boudoir. In his leisure time, Injahuan also came to play.
When I met Baochai, Xiangling, and Ying'er playing Go, Jia Huan also wanted to play.
Baochai looked at him like Baoyu, but he didn't want it. I heard him want to play today, let him come up and sit down to play.
One bet ten dollars.
The first time I won, I liked it very much.
Unexpectedly, after losing a few sets in a row, I was a little anxious.
In this game, he should roll the dice by himself. If he rolls seven points, he wins; if he rolls six points, he should roll three points and Yinger wins.
Because of picking up the dice and throwing it fiercely, one sits down and the other spins randomly.
Ying'er clapped her hands and called "Huh!"
Jia Huan stared, "Six!" "Seven!" "Eight!" screamed.
Did the dice roll out?
Jia Huan was in a hurry. He reached out and grabbed the dice. He was about to take the money, saying it was six o'clock.
Ying'er said, "Is it obviously!"
Seeing that Jia Huan was anxious, Baochai glanced at Ying'er and said, "The bigger the bigger, the more unruly!
Does the man still rely on you?
Don't put down the money yet. "
Ying'er was full of aggrieved feelings. Seeing the girl said, she didn't dare to speak out, so she had to put down her money and muttered in her mouth:
"A master still relies on our money, even I look down upon it!
Qian'er played with Bao Erye, he didn't worry if he lost, the remaining money was still grabbed by a few little girls, and he just laughed. "
Baochai drank without waiting to finish.
Jia Huan said: "What can I compare Baoyu?
If you are afraid of him, be nice to him, and bully me, not raised by my wife! "
I cried as I said.
Baochai hurriedly persuaded him: "Good brother, don't say this, people are jokes."
He scolded Yinger again.
Just as Baoyu came, seeing this situation, asked: "What's the matter?"
Jia Huan did not dare to speak.
Baochai knows the rules of his family, and anyone who is a brother is afraid of his brother.
But I don't know that Baoyu doesn't want people to be afraid of him.
He thought: "Brothers have all learned from their parents, why I am troubled, so strange.
Besides, I'm outright, he's a concubine. I think it's such a good way. There are still people talking behind the scenes, but he is forbidden to rule him? "
There is even more dullness in my heart.
What are you stupid?
Because he grew up in a group of young sisters, his sisters have the Yuanchun trip, his uncles welcome the spring and cherish the spring, and his relatives include Xiangyun, Daiyu, Baochai and others. For women, men are nothing more than scum.
Therefore, treating all men as muddy things is optional.
It's just the relationship between father, uncle, and brother. Because it is the legacy of a saint, I dare not violate it. Therefore, the brothers can only try their best. I don't want to be a man. I need to be an example of my children.
Therefore, Jia Huan and others were not very afraid of him, only because he was afraid that Jia's mother would not follow him, he had to give him three points.
Now Baochai was afraid that Baoyu would teach him, but it was boring, so he quickly covered up for Jia Huan.
Baoyu said: "In the Great New Year, why are you crying?
It's not good here, go play elsewhere.
You are confused when you study every day.
For example, if this item is not good, and the other one is good, then we will give up this one and take the other.
Could it be that you just keep this thing and cry for a while?
You were trying to make fun of yourself, but you were bothering yourself.
Not hurry up! "
Jia Huan listened and had to come back.
Seeing him like this, Auntie Zhao asked: "Where is the kicking nest here?"
Without answering a question, Jia Huan said, "Sister Tongbao was playing.
Yinger bullied me and relied on my money; Brother Baoyu sent me to come. "
Aunt Zhao said:
"Who told you to go to the high platform?
Obscene and faceless things!
Can't play there?
Who told you to run to beg this boring? "
As she was talking, Sister Qiaofeng passed by the window, and when she heard her ears, she said through the window:
"In the Great New Year, what happened?
Brothers, children, half a little wrong, you only teach him, what do you do with this?
What's the matter with him, and the old man and wife care about him?
He is now the master, no, there are people who teach him, what does it have to do with you?
Ring brother, come out!
Play with me. "
Jia Huan Suri was more afraid of Sister Feng than Madam Wang, so he hurried out when he heard calling him.
Aunt Zhao did not dare to speak out.
Sister Feng said to Jia Huan: "You are also a dull thing!
I often tell you: if you want to eat, drink, and play, if you love to play with that elder sister, sister, brother, and sister-in-law, just play with that.
You always don't listen to me, but let these people teach you to twist your heart and evil intentions and sing the nightmare.
I don't respect myself, so I want to go downhill, settle my bad heart, and only blame others for partiality.
Lost a few money, that's it! "
Because he asked Jia Huan: "How much did you lose?"
When Jia Huan asked, he had no choice but to say: "Lose one or two hundred dollars."
Sister Feng tweeted: "You're still a master if you lose, and you just lose one or two hundred dollars!"
He turned back and said, "Feng'er, go and get a sling; the girls are all playing in the back, so they sent him away.
If you are so fox-meizi tomorrow, I will hit you first, and then I will ask someone to tell Xueli that the skin will not expose you!
Because you are not honorable, your brother is itching with hatred, but I didn't stop him, he was so heartbroken that your intestines came out! "
Warned: "Go!"
Jia Huanuo Nuo, got money from Feng'er, and went to play with Yingchun and so on.
Let’s say that Baoyu was joking with Baochai, and suddenly someone said, "Girl Shi is here."
Baoyu listened and left quickly.
Baochai smiled and said, "Wait, let's go together and see him."
With that, I got off the kang and came to Jia's mother with Baoyu.
I saw Shi Xiangyun talking and laughing, and when I saw the two of them, he hurriedly stood up and said hello.
Just as Daiyu was by the side, she asked Baoyu, "Where are you calling?"
Baoyu said, "Sister Dabao, come there."
Daiyu sneered and said, "What I said!
If I stumbled, I would have already flown here. "
Baoyu said: "I can only play with you to relieve your boredom;
But by chance, I said these gossips. "
Dai Yu said: "What a boring thing!
What do you care about me?
I didn't ask you to relieve my boredom!
Maybe you will ignore me from now on! "
After speaking, he went back to the room in anger.
Baoyu hurriedly followed and asked, "I'm very angry again!
Even if I was wrong, are you still sitting there, joking with others for a while? "
Dai Yu said: "You care about me!"
Baoyu smiled and said, "Naturally I don't dare to care about you, it's just that you have been ruined by yourself."
Dai Yu said: "I have trampled on my body, and I am dead, what is it to you?"
Baoyu said: "Why bother?
In the Great New Year, ‘dead’ and ‘alive’. "
Dai Yu said, "I mean ‘dead’!
I will die in a while!
You are afraid of death, you live a long life, OK? "
Baoyu smiled and said, "If I just want to make trouble, am I still afraid of death?
It would be better to die clean. "
Daiyu hurriedly said: "That's right, if it's so troublesome, it's better to die clean!"
Baoyu said: "I said that my house is dead and clean. Don't misunderstand what I said, and I'm sloppy."
While talking, Baochai came over and said, "Sister Shi is waiting for you."
With that, Baoyu left.
This Daiyu became more and more frustrated, and only shed tears at the window.
When there were no two cups of tea, Baoyu still came.
When Daiyu saw it, she couldn't help crying more and more.
Baoyu saw this, knowing that it would be hard to save it, and layered up all kinds of words to comfort him.
Unexpectedly, I didn't open my mouth. I just heard Daiyu first say: "What are you doing again?
It's up to me to live and die!
Anyway, someone is playing with you now: I am better at reading, writing, writing, talking and laughing than me, and I am afraid that you will be angry, so I will coax you when I pull you.
What are you doing? "
Baoyu heard this, and hurriedly stepped forward and said quietly: "You are such a sensible person, don't you even know that'you don't get separated, and you don't presume first'?
Although I am confused, I understand these two sentences.
First, we are aunts and sisters, and sister Bao is two aunts and sisters, and we are farther away than you in terms of relatives.
The second thing is, you come first. Let's eat at one table and sleep on the same bed. He grew up in the same place. He just came. Is there anyone who is far away from you? "
Daiyu tweeted: "Do I tell you to stay away from him?
Who have I become?
I am for my heart! "
Baoyu said, "I also do it for my heart.
Do you know your heart, don't you know my heart is not? "
After hearing this, Daiyu bowed her head and said for a long time: "You only blame others for actions and blame you. You don't know that people who are surprised are uncomfortable.
Let’s compare it with today’s weather, which is clearly colder. Why did you take off your green cloak? "
Baoyu smiled and said, "Why didn't you wear it?
Seeing you annoyed, I got irritated and got off. "
Daiyu sighed, "I came back and hurt the wind, so it's time to be arrogant again."
The two were talking when they saw Xiang Yun coming and smiling:
"Brother Love, Sister Lin, you play every day. I came here so easily and ignored me."
Daiyu smiled and said: "It just bites his tongue and loves to talk, and he can't even call the'two' brother. It's just'love' brother and'love' brother.
When you come back to play Go, it's time for you to make trouble again. "
Baoyu smiled and said: "You are used to learning, and tomorrow you will bite you."
Xiang Yun said: "If he doesn't let anyone go, he will pick people.
Even if you are better than the rest of the world, you are not guilty of making fun of each other.
I point out someone, if you dare to pick him, I will convince you. "
Daiyu asked, "Who is it?"
Xiang Yun said, "You dare to pick the shortcomings of Sister Bao, even if you are a good one."
After hearing this, Daiyu sneered and said, "Who am I? It turns out it is him.
Where can I dare to pick him? "
Baoyu didn't wait to finish, but separated with words.
Xiang Yun smiled and said, "I can't compare to you in my life.
I only bless you to have a tongue-in-cheek brother-in-law Lin, you can always listen to "love" and "evil"!
Amitabha, only then is now in my eyes! "
Said Baoyu smiled, Xiang Yun hurriedly turned around and ran.
Be careful, and listen to the next breakdown.
