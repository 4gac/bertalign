"It's okay, I have no radioactivity."
Shi Qiang said to Wang Miao, who was sitting next to him, "In the past few days, I let people turn out and wash them like a facial wash pocket.
There was no arrangement for you to attend this meeting. I insisted on asking you to come. Hey, I'm sure that our brothers will show off this time. "
As Shi Qiang said, he picked a cigar butt from the ashtray on the conference table, lighted it and took a sip, nodded, and spit out the smoke slowly in front of the opposite participants. Among them was the original cigar. Owner Stanton, a US Marine Corps colonel, cast a contemptuous look at Da Shi.
This time there were more foreign soldiers who attended the meeting, and they all wore military uniforms.
For the first time in human history, the armed forces of the world faced a common enemy.
General Chang Weisi said: "Comrades, everyone present at the meeting has a basic understanding of the current situation. In the words of Da Shi, the information is equal.
The war between humans and alien invaders has begun. Although it will be four and a half centuries before our children and grandchildren will truly face the trisolaran invaders from alien planets, we are still fighting against humans;
But in essence, these human betrayers can also be seen as enemies from outside the earth’s civilization. This is the first time we have faced such an enemy.
The next combat goal is very clear, which is to seize the intercepted three-body information on the Judgment Day. This information may be of great significance to the survival of human civilization. "
"We have not alarmed the'Judgment Day'. This huge ship is still travelling in the Atlantic Ocean with a legal status. It has applied to the Panama Canal Authority and will pass the canal in four days.
This is an excellent opportunity for us to take action, and as the situation develops, it is likely that there will not be such an opportunity again.
Now, various combat centers around the world are formulating action plans, and these plans will be selected and determined by the headquarters within ten hours.
Our task at this meeting is to discuss the action plan and finally determine one to three most feasible ones to report to headquarters.
Everyone, time is tight, and we must work with maximum efficiency. "
"Please note that all plans must ensure one thing: to ensure the safety of the Trisolaran information on the'Judgment Day' and seize it.
The "Judgment Day" was modified by an oil tanker, and complicated structures were added to the upper and interior of the hull. It is said that even the crew members must rely on the map to identify the way when entering areas that are not frequent. Our understanding of its structure is only Less.
At present, we don’t even know the exact location of the computer center on the ‘Judgment Day’ or whether the intercepted trisomy information is stored on the computer center’s server and there are several backups.
The only way we can achieve our goal is to fully occupy and control the'Judgment Day'. The most difficult part of this is to prevent the enemy from deleting the three-body information during the attack.
It is extremely easy to delete this information. The enemy is unlikely to perform regular deletion in an emergency, because it is easy to restore with the current technology, but only need to hit the server hard disk or other storage devices with a shuttle, and everything is over. It can be done in seconds.
And we must disable the enemy's ability to move near the storage device within ten seconds before the action is detected.
Since the location of the storage device is unknown, and the number of backups is not clear, it is necessary to eliminate all enemies on the Judgment Day in a very short period of time before being detected by the target. In particular, computer equipment caused major damage.
Therefore, this task is very difficult, some people even think it is impossible to complete. "
A Japanese Self-Defense Force officer said: "We believe that the only possible successful operation is with the help of our scouts who are lurking inside the Judgment Day and are familiar with the storage location of the three-body information. Or transfer storage equipment."
Someone asked: "The surveillance and reconnaissance of the'Judgment Day' has always been the responsibility of NATO military intelligence agencies and the CIA. Is there such a lurker?"
"No," the NATO coordinator said.
"Then what we have left behind is nonsense." Da Shi inserted a sentence and immediately met with many people's eyes.
Colonel Stanton said: "To destroy the personnel inside a closed structure without causing damage to other facilities, the first thing we thought of was the ball lightning weapon."
Ding Yi shook his head: "No, this weapon is already well known. We don't know whether the hull is equipped with a magnetic wall to shield ball lightning;
Even if not, although the ball lightning can guarantee the elimination of all personnel in the ship, it cannot guarantee the simultaneity;
Moreover, after the ball lightning enters the interior of the hull, it may have to wander in the air for a period of time before releasing energy. This period of time may be as short as ten seconds, and may reach a minute or more as long as they have time to detect the attack. And take actions that destroy information. "
Colonel Stanton said, "What about the neutron bomb?"
"Colonel, you should know that it won't work either!"
A Russian officer said, “Neutron radiation cannot kill you instantly. After the neutron bomb attack, the enemy in the ship will have enough time to hold a meeting like ours.”
"The other option is nerve gas, but because of its release and diffusion in the ship, it is impossible to achieve the goal stated by the general." A NATO officer said.
"The remaining options are shock bombs and infrasonic waves."
Colonel Stanton said that people were looking forward to his following, but he did not go on to say anything.
Da Shi said: "The shock bomb is a gadget used by our police. It can indeed stun people in the building at once, but it seems that it is only useful for one or two rooms.
Can you stun someone as big as a boat at a time? "
Stanton shook his head, "No, even if there is, it is impossible for such a large explosive to not damage the facilities inside the ship."
"What about infrasonic weapons?" someone asked.
"It is still in the experimental stage and cannot be used in actual combat.
Especially the ship is very huge. With the power of the infrasonic weapon currently being tested, if it attacks the entire'Judgment Day' at the same time, it will at most make the dizziness inside it sick. "
"Ha," Da Shi said, with only a peanut-sized cigar head left, "I said that the rest is nonsense. It's been a long time. Remember the chief's words: time is pressing!"
He turned to the interpreter with a smirk, a beautiful female lieutenant with an uncomfortable expression, "Go back, comrade, as long as you mean it."
But Stanton actually seemed to understand. He pointed to Shi Qiang with a cigar he had just drawn and said, "What qualifications does this policeman have to speak to us like this?"
"What about your qualifications?"
Da Shi asked rhetorically.
"Col. Stanton is a senior special operations expert. He has participated in almost all major military operations since the Vietnam War," said a NATO officer.
"Then tell you my qualifications: more than 20 years ago, the reconnaissance platoon I belonged to, interspersed with the Vietnamese army tens of kilometers in depth, occupied a tightly fortified hydroelectric power station there, and prevented the Vietnamese from bombing the dam to block our army's attack. The plan of the road.
This is my qualification: I have defeated the enemy who defeated you. "
"Enough history!"
Chang Weisi patted the table and said, "Don't go far, you can tell your plan."
"I don't think there is any need to waste time on this policeman."
Colonel Stanton said contemptuously, and started lighting his cigar.
Without waiting for the translator to translate, Da Shi jumped up and said, "Police, I heard this word twice. Why, look down on the police?
Speaking of throwing a bunch of bombs to blast the big ship to pieces, then you soldiers should go;
But if you take something out of it intact, don't look at the stars on your shoulders, it's not as good as a thief.
This kind of thing requires evil tricks, absolutely evil tricks!
This, you are far inferior to criminals, they are masters of evil tricks!
Know how evil that trick can be?
I have done a theft case in which the criminal was able to steal a carriage in the middle of a moving train, and the rest of the front and back were connected intact and drove to the terminal. The only tools used were a wire rope and a few iron hooks.
This is the special operations expert!
And the serious criminal police who have been in the grassroots for more than ten years like me have received their best training and education. "
"Talk about your plan, otherwise don't speak again!" Chang Weisi pointed to Da Shi.
"There are so many heavyweights here. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to take my turn. Then the old leader would say that I am rude."
"You have been rude to home!
Hurry up.
Talk about your evil tricks! "
Shi Qiang picked up a pen and drew two curved parallel lines on the desktop, "This is a canal."
He picked up the ashtray and placed it between the two lines, "This is the Judgment Day."
Then he leaned over the tabletop and pulled off the cigar that Colonel Stanton had just lit.
"I can't tolerate this idiot!" the colonel stood up and shouted.
"Shi Qiang, go out." Chang Weisi said sharply.
"It will take one minute until I finish."
As Da Shi spoke, he extended his other hand to Stanton.
"What?" the colonel asked puzzled.
"Give me another one."
Stanton hesitated, took another cigar from an exquisite wooden box and handed it to Shi Qiang. The latter pressed the smoking end of the first cigar onto the table and made it stand on the Panama Canal painted on the table. On the bank, flatten one end of the other branch and stand on the other side of the "canal".
"Two pillars were erected on both sides of the canal, and many filaments were pulled in parallel between the pillars, and the spacing was about half a meter. These filaments were made by Professor Wang and the others called ‘flying blade’ nanomaterials.”
After Shi Qiang finished speaking, he stood there and waited for a few seconds, raised his hands and said to the people who hadn't reacted yet: "It's over, that's all."
After speaking, he turned and walked out of the venue.
The air solidified, everyone was motionless like petrified, and even the buzzing of the surrounding computers seemed to be cautious.
I don’t know how long it took before someone timidly broke the silence: "Professor Jiang, is the'flying blade' silky?"
Wang Miao nodded, "Using our existing molecular building technology, we can only produce silk-like materials, the thickness of which is about one-tenth of the hair...
These police officers will get to know me beforehand. "
"Is there enough available?"
"How wide is the canal?
The height of the ship? "
"The narrowest part of the canal is 150 meters. The'Judgment Day' is 31 meters high and has a draft of about eight meters."
Wang Miao stared at the cigar on the table and made a rough calculation, "Basically enough."
There was another long silence, and the participants were trying to recover from their shock.
"What if the equipment that stores the three-body information, such as hard disks and discs, is also cut?" someone asked.
"It's not a big chance."
"It's not a big problem to be cut," said a computer expert. "The filaments are extremely sharp and the cuts must be straight. In this state, whether it is a hard disk or an integrated circuit storage body, the information in it is absolutely Most of them can be restored."
"Are there other more feasible solutions?"
Chang Weien looked at the meeting place, no one said, "Okay, let's focus on this plan and start studying the details."
Colonel Stanton, who had been silent, stood up, "I'll call the police officer back."
Chang Weisi waved for him to sit down, and then shouted: "Da Shi!"
Shi Qiang walked in, looked at everyone with that smirk, picked up the two cigars on the table by the "canal", stuffed the lit one into his mouth, and put the other in his pocket.
Someone asked: "When the'Judgment Day' passes, can the two pillars withstand the'flying blade'?
Will the pillar be cut first? "
Wang Miao said: "This can be solved. There are a small amount of flaky'flying blade' material that can be used as a gasket for the fixing of the filament on the column."
The following discussion was mainly conducted between naval officers and navigation experts.
"The'Judgment Day' is the largest tonnage ship that the Panama Canal can pass through. The draft is very deep, so the deployment of nanowires under water must also be considered."
"The underwater part is more difficult. If time is too late, you can give it up. The engine, fuel, and some ballasts are mainly placed there. The noise, vibration and interference are very large. The environment is harsh. Computer centers and similar institutions are unlikely to be located there. position.
But on the water part, if the spacing of the nanowires is smaller, the effect will definitely be better. "
"Then it’s best to do it in one of the three locks on the canal. The Judgment Day is a Panamanian-sized ship that just fills up the locks when it passes. The length of the flying blade is only about 32 meters. The spacing can be very small, and the operation of uprights and wire drawing is relatively easy, especially for underwater parts."
"No, the situation at the ship lock is complicated. The ship has to be towed by four rail locomotives during questioning. The speed is very slow, and it must be the most vigilant time on the Judgment Day. It is very likely during the cutting process. be found."
"Can you consider the Bridge of the Americas outside the Miraflores lock?
The pier can be used as a wire drawing column. "
"No, the distance between the piers is too wide, and the material for the'flying blade' is definitely not enough."
"Then we have determined that the action position is the narrowest part of the Gaillard Channel, one hundred and fifty meters wide, and counting the margin for the pillars, let's press one hundred and seventy meters."
Wang Miao said: "If this is the case, the minimum distance between drawing is fifty centimeters. No matter how small, the material is not enough."
"That said," Da Shi let out a puff of smoke, "I have to think of letting the ship cross the canal during the day."
"why?"
"The people on the boat sleep at night. They are all lying down. The space of fifty centimeters is too big. During the day they are sitting or squatting, which is enough."
There were a few sporadic laughs, and the people under the weight felt a ribbon of bloody relief.
"You are really a devil." A female UN official said to Da Shi.
"Will it hurt the innocent?"
Wang Miao asked, his voice trembling that was clearly audible.
A naval officer replied: "There are more than a dozen cable workers to board the ship when passing the lock, but after the ship passes, they go off.
The Panamanian pilots who have to accompany the ship to complete the 82-kilometer canal must be sacrificed. "
A CIA official said: "There are also some crew members on the Judgment Day. They may not know what the ship is doing."
"Professor, don't think about these things now, this is not something you have to consider.
The information we want to obtain is related to the survival of human civilization, and someone will make the final decision. "Chang Weisi said.
When the meeting ended, Colonel Stanton pushed the exquisite wooden cigar box in front of Shi Qiang: "Police officer, the best Havana, I gave it to you."
Four days later, the Gaillard Waterway of the Panama Canal.
Wang Miao didn't feel at all in a foreign country.
He knew that not far to the west was the beautiful Gatun Lake, and to the east were the magnificent Bridge of the Americas and Panama City, but he had never seen it. Two days ago, he flew directly from China to Palermo near Panama City by plane. Kumen military airport, and then went directly here by helicopter.
The scenery in front of us is too ordinary. The ongoing canal widening project has made the tropical rainforest on the hillsides on both sides sparse, and large patches of loess are exposed on the slopes. The color really makes Johnson feel familiar with this place.
The canal also looks very ordinary, probably because it is very narrow in this section.
This section of the waterway was excavated by one hundred thousand people with a shovel at the beginning of the last century.
Wang Miao and Colonel Stanton sat on the deck chairs of a pavilion on the hillside. Both were wearing large floral shirts and large straw hats thrown aside. They looked like two ordinary tourists.
In this position, the canal below has a panoramic view.
On the two banks of the canal just below them, two steel pillars of 24 meters long lay flat, and fifty ultra-strength nanowires of 160 meters have been connected to the two at a distance of about 0.5 meters. On the steel column, only the end of each nanowire on the right bank is also connected with a piece of ordinary steel wire. This allows the nanowire to sink to the bottom of the river with the falling objects attached to it. This is done to allow other ships to pass.
Fortunately, transportation on the canal is not as busy as Wang Miao imagined. On average, only about forty large ships pass through each day.
Both ends of the two steel columns are connected with a living hinge. Only when the last ship in front of the "Judgment Day" passes, can the ordinary steel wire be pulled back, and the nanowires are finally fixed on the steel column on the right bank. Stand up.
The code name of the action is "Guzheng", which is a natural association, and the cut net made of nanowires is called "Qin".
An hour ago, the "Judgment Day" was sailed from Gatun Lake to the Gaillard Channel.
Stanton asked if Wang Miao had been to Panama before. Wang Miao said no.
"I came here in 1989." said the colonel.
"Is that the war?"
"Yes, but it was the least memorable war for me. I just remembered to play Jackson's rock dance "Nowhere to Run" for the besieged President Noriega in front of the Vatican Embassy. That was my idea."
In the canal below, a snow-white French cruise ship is slowly passing by, and on the deck covered with green carpets, there are a few colorful tourists wandering around.
"Observation post No. 2 reported that there are no ships ahead of the target."
Stanton's walkie-talkie rang.
"Stand up the'Qin'," Stanton ordered.
Several people who looked like workers wearing hard hats appeared on both sides of the strait.
Wang Miao stood up, but the colonel stopped him, "Professor, don't worry, they will do well."
Wang Miao watched the people on the right bank drew back the ordinary steel wire connected to the nanowire, and fixed the tight nanowire on the steel column.
Then, people on both sides of the strait pulled several long steel cables at the same time, so that the two steel columns were slowly erected.
In order to disguise, some navigation marks and water level signs were hung on the two steel pillars.
They worked very calmly, and even looked a little lazy, as if they were doing a dull job.
Wang Miao stared at the space between the steel columns. There seemed to be nothing but the piano of death was already in place.
"The target is four kilometers away from the piano!" said the voice on the walkie-talkie.
Stanton put down the walkie-talkie and resumed the topic just now:
"I came to Panama for the second time in 1999. I participated in the ceremony for the transfer of sovereignty over the canal. It was strange. When we came to the administration building, we saw that the Stars and Stripes had been lowered. It was said that it was lowered one day in advance at the request of the US government. To avoid the embarrassing scene of lowering the flag in front of everyone...
I thought I was witnessing a historic moment, but now I think about how trivial these things are. "
"The goal is three kilometers away from the piano!"
"Yes, it's trivial." Wang Miao agreed.
He didn't hear what Stanton was talking about, the rest of the world no longer existed for him, and all his attention was focused on the "Judgment Day" that had not yet appeared in his vision.
At this time, the morning sun rising from the east coast of the Pacific Ocean was setting toward the west coast of the Pacific Ocean. The golden light was sparkling in the canal. Nearer below, the piano of death stood quietly, and the two steel pillars were dark and could not reflect. A little sunlight looks older than the canal flowing through them.
"The goal is two kilometers away from the piano!"
Stanton didn't seem to hear the voice on the walkie-talkie, and was still talking: "Since I learned that the alien fleet is flying towards the earth, I have amnesia.
It’s strange that I can’t remember the past. I mean the wars I have experienced. I can’t remember them. As I said earlier, those wars are so trivial.
After knowing this, everyone will become a new person in spirit, and the world will become a new world.
I have been thinking, assuming that two thousand years ago or earlier, people knew that an alien invasion fleet would arrive in a few thousand years. What is the current human civilization like?
Professor, can you imagine it? "
"Oh, can't..."
Wang Miao was absent-mindedly perfunctory.
"The goal is 1.5 kilometers away from Qin!"
"Professor, I think you will become the Gaillard of the new century, and we look forward to the completion of your Panama Canal.
Isn't it?
The space elevator is actually a canal. Just like the Panama Canal connects two oceans, the space elevator connects the earth and space..."
Wang Miao now knows that the colonel nagging these meaningless nonsense is actually trying to help him through this difficult time.
He was grateful, but it didn't help much.
"The goal is one kilometer from the piano!"
The "Judgment Day" appeared. In the rays of the setting sun from the side ridge, it was a black silhouette on a golden wave on the river.
This 60,000-ton-class ship was much larger than Wang Miao imagined. When it appeared, it seemed as if a mountain had emerged from the west. Although Wang Miao knew that the canal could pass ships of 70,000-ton class, he witnessed such a giant ship. There is indeed a strange feeling when driving in such a narrow river.
Compared with its hugeness, the river below seems to no longer exist, it is like a large mountain moving on land.
After adapting to the light of the rising sun, Wang Miao saw that the hull of the "Judgment Day" was black, the superstructure was white, and the giant antenna was missing.
The roar of the huge wheel engine can already be heard, and there is also a roar of water, which is emitted by the waves pushed up by its round bow hitting both banks of the canal.
As the distance between "Judgment Day" and the piano of death shortened, Wang Miao's heartbeat suddenly accelerated, and his breathing became quicker. He had an urge to flee immediately, but a wave of weakness made him unable to control his body.
There was a burst of hatred towards Shi Qiang in his heart. How could this bastard come up with such an idea? !
As the female UN official said, he is a devil!
But this feeling was fleeting, and he thought that if Da Shi was around now, his situation would be much better.
Colonel Stanton had applied for Da Shi to come together, but Chang Weisi didn't approve it, and he was more needed there now.
Wang Miao felt the colonel pat his hand.
"Professor, everything will pass."
The "Judgment Day" is passing, it is passing through the piano of death.
When its bow touched the seemingly empty plane between the two steel technologies, Wang Miao's scalp tightened, but nothing happened. The huge hull of the giant ship slowly passed between the two steel technologies.
When the ship passed halfway through, Wang Miao even wondered if the nanowires between the steel columns really did not exist.
But a small sign denied his suspicion. He noticed that a slender antenna at the top of the ship's superstructure had broken from below, and the antenna rolled down.
Soon, the second sign of nanowires appeared, and this almost caused Wang Miao to collapse completely.
The wide deck of the "Judgment Day" was very empty, except that there was a person on the rear deck washing the bollards with a tap. Wang Miao could see clearly from a height, when this part of the ship moved between the steel columns, The man's body suddenly stiffened, and the faucet slipped from his hand;
At the same time, the rubber hose connected to the faucet broke in two not far away, and the water spurted out from there. The man stood upright for a few seconds before falling down, his body was touching. The deck is divided into two sections at the same time.
The upper part of the man was still crawling in a pool of blood, but he could only crawl with two and a half arms because his arm was also cut in half.
After passing the two steel pillars at the stern, the "Judgment Day" was still moving forward at a constant speed, and no more anomalies could be seen for a while.
But Wang Miao heard the sound of the engine twisted weirdly, and was replaced by a loud noise. The sound sounded like a wrench being thrown into the rotor of a large motor. No, it was a lot of wrenches. Knowing that this is emitted after the rotating part of the engine is cut.
After a harsh cracking sound, a hole appeared on the side of the stern of the Judgment Day, which was knocked out by a huge metal structure.
The flying component immediately fell into the water and stirred up a high water column. When it flashed past, Wang Miao saw that it was a section of the crankshaft of the ship's engine.
A thick smoke gushed out of the hole, and the "Judgment Day", which had sailed straight on the right bank for a while, dragged the tail of the smoke and started to turn, quickly crossed the river and hit the left bank.
Wang Miao saw that the huge bow that washed up on the bank was deformed sharply, and at the same time it washed away the soil like water, stirring up turbulent earth waves.
At the same time, the "Judgment Day" began to disperse into more than forty slices. Each slice is half a meter thick. From this distance, it is a slice of thin slabs. The upper slice has the fastest forward speed, which is the same as the lower one. Staggered, this huge ship resembles a stack of playing cards being pushed forward. These forty giant flakes rub against each other as they slide, making a sharp and strange sound, like countless huge fingers scratching the glass.
After the unbearable voice disappeared, the "Judgment Day" had turned into a pile of flakes on the shore, and rushed farther and farther forward, like a stack of plates poured forward from the hands of a tripped waiter. .
Those flakes looked as soft as cloth pieces, and quickly deformed into a complex shape, which makes it hard to imagine that it was a giant ship.
A large number of soldiers began to rush from the hillside to the river bank. Wang Miao was amazed when and where so many people were hidden nearby.
A group of helicopters roared and flew along the canal, over the river covered with a layer of colorful oil, hovering over the wreck of the "Judgment Day", throwing a large amount of white fire extinguishing agent and foam, and quickly controlling the spread of the wreckage In the fire, the other three helicopters quickly used clues to drop the search personnel towards the wreckage.
Colonel Stanton had already left. Wang Miao picked up the telescope he put on his straw hat and overcame the shaking of his hands to observe the "Judgment Day" which was cut into more than forty pieces by "Flying Blade."
At this time, more than half of it has been covered by fire extinguishing powder and foam, but a part is still exposed.
Wang Miao saw the cut surface, which was as smooth as a mirror, reflecting the fiery glow of the sky without any deviation.
He also saw a dark red round spot on the mirror, not sure if it was blood.
Three days later.
Interrogator: Do you understand the three-body civilization?
Ye Wenjie: I don’t know. The information we have is very limited. In fact, the true and detailed appearance of the Trisolaran civilization is unknown to anyone except Evans and other core Adventists who intercepted the Trisolaran information.
Interrogator: Then why do you have such expectations for them, thinking they can transform and perfect human society?
Ye Wenjie: If they can cross the stars and come to our world, it means that their science has developed to a considerable height. A society with such a prosperous science must have a higher level of civilization and morality.
Interrogator: Do you think this conclusion is scientific in itself?
Ye Wenjie:...
Interrogator: Let me take the liberty to speculate: Your father was deeply influenced by your grandfather's scientific thinking of saving the country, and you were deeply influenced by your father.
Ye Wenzhi (sighed involuntarily): I don't know.
Interrogator: Now to tell you, we have got all the three-body information intercepted by the Adventists.
Ye Wenjie: Oh... how is Evans?
Interrogator: He died while taking action on the "Judgment Day".
(Evans was cut into three segments by the "flying blade".
At that time he was in the command center of the Judgment Day. The top part of him crawled forward for more than one meter. When he died, he stared at the direction he was crawling, which was in a computer in that direction. The intercepted three-body information was found. )
Ye Wenjie: Is there a lot of information?
Interrogator: A lot, about 28G.
Ye Wenjie: This is impossible. The efficiency of interstellar ultra-long-distance communication is very low. How can it be possible to transmit such a large amount of information? !
Interrogator: We thought the same way at the beginning, but things far exceeded everyone's imagination, even the boldest and most bizarre.
Well, please read part of this information, and you will see what the Trisolaran civilization in your beautiful fantasy looks like.
