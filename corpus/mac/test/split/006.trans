Husband Hai asked about what he did today. Wei Xiaobao said that he went to Obai’s house to copy the house. As for the engulfing of treasures, gold and silver, daggers, etc., he would not mention anything, and finally said: "The queen mother ordered me to take two copies at Obai’s house" Forty-two chapters "..."
Husband Hai suddenly stood up and asked, "There are two "Forty-two Chapters" in Obai's family?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "Yes.
It was ordered by the Queen Mother and the emperor to get it. Otherwise, I brought it to you, and others may not know it. "
Old man Hai's face was gloomy, he snorted, and said coldly: "I fell into the hands of the queen mother, very good, very good!"
After the meal was delivered from the kitchen, the husband only ate a small bowl and then stopped eating. He rolled a pair of godless eyes and raised his head just thinking about it.
After Wei Xiaobao finished the meal, he thought I would sleep for a while, and then go to talk to the little palace lady at the third shift. Seeing her husband sitting still, she went to bed with her clothes.
He slept in a daze for a while, quietly got up, put the box of candied cakes in his arms, afraid of awakening her husband, and slowly tipped out step by step, walked to the door, and gently unlatched the door. He opened a door gently, and suddenly I heard her husband ask: "Little Guizi, where are you going?"
Wei Xiaobao was taken aback, and said, "I... I'll urinate."
Mrs. Hai said, "Why don't you urinate in the house?"
Wei Xiaobao said, "I can't sleep, I'll walk around in the garden."
I didn't say much for fear of husband Hai's obstruction. He stepped out and walked out. Just taking a step on his left foot, I felt that the back collar was tight, and the husband had caught him and brought it back.
Wei Xiaobao screamed with "Ah", and then he thought: "Oops, oh, the old tortoise knew I was going to see the little palace lady, so I was not allowed to go."
The thoughts were not finished yet, and he fell on the bed to her husband Hai.
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "Father-in-law, will you try my martial arts?
I haven't taught me kung fu for several days. What kind of trick is this catch? "
Husband Hai snorted and said, "This is called'catch a turtle in the urn,' and it's a catch.
The turtle is the soft-shelled turtle, catch you little turtle. "
Wei Xiaobao said in his heart: "The old turtle catches the little turtle!"
But after all, he didn't dare to say it, his eyes rolled skeptically, thinking about how to get out.
Husband Hai sat on the edge of his bed and said softly, "You are bold and careful, smart and smart. Although you are unwilling to learn martial arts, if I think about it, you can be considered a manufacturable material. What a pity. "
Wei Xiaobao asked, "Father-in-law, what a pity?"
Husband Hai didn't answer, only sighed, and after a while, he said, "You've learned almost the same in Beijing movies.
A few months ago, if you would say such a thing, it would not be easy to detect without the slightest Yangzhou accent. "
Wei Xiaobao was taken aback. All of a sudden, his whole body was chilly, and he couldn't help shaking his body. He slammed his teeth together, and said with a strong smile: "Father-in-law, you... What you said tonight is... Hehe... It's really strange. "
Husband Hai sighed again and asked, "My child, how old are you this year?"
Wei Xiaobao heard him sound very kind, and his fright diminished, and said, "I... I'm fourteen years old."
Mrs. Hai said: "When you are 13 years old, you are 13 years old, and when you are 14 years old, you are 14.
Wei Xiaobao said: "My mother can't remember very much, I don't know it myself."
This sentence is the truth, his mother is confused, and how old is Xiaobao is not always accurate.
Husband Hai nodded, coughed a few times, and said: "I practiced Kungfu a few years ago, and I got so bad that I got this cough. The more I cough, the worse I know in recent years."
Wei Xiaobao said: "I... I think you have recently... coughed better recently."
Husband Hai shook his head and said, "What's so good?
Not good at all.
My chest hurts so badly, how do you know? "
Wei Xiaobao said: "How is it now?
Do you want me to take some medicine for you? "
The old man Hai sighed, "I can't see it. You can't take medicine indiscriminately."
Wei Xiaobao didn't dare to be too big, because he didn't know what he meant by saying these words.
The old man Hai said again: "You have a good chance, and you are in favor of the emperor. You could have done something big.
If you didn't cleanse, it doesn't matter if I clean it for you, but, alas, it's too late, it's too late. "
Wei Xiaobao didn't understand the meaning of "cleansing". He only felt that the tone of his words tonight was unspeakable. He whispered softly: "Father-in-law, it's late, you just sleep."
Mr. Hai said: "Sleep, sleep!
Alas, when I go to bed, I will have more afterwards. I sleep in the morning and night, and I never wake up when I fall asleep.
Child, a person always sleeps alone without getting up, no heartache, no cough, isn't that pretty? "
Wei Xiaobao was too frightened to make a sound.
Mrs. Hai said, "My child, who else is in your family?"
Wei Xiaobao couldn't answer this plain question.
He didn’t know who was in the dead Little Guizi’s family. He replied indiscriminately. Most of the time he showed his feet, but he had to answer. He only hoped that Mrs. Hai didn’t know the details of Xiao Guizi’s family, so he asked like this, saying, "I only have This old lady, the rest, these years, alas, there is no need to mention it."
With such a tail in his words, if Xiao Guizi still has his father, brothers and sisters, he might as well use the six words "no need to mention" as an excuse.
Mr. Hai said, "There is only one old lady.
In your Hokkien dialect, what is the name of your mother? "
Wei Xiaobao was surprised again:
"What Hokkien?
Could it be that Xiao Guizi is from Fujian?
He said that there was a Yangzhou accent in my previous speech, I'm afraid... I'm afraid... Then he blinded me, does he know? "
In an instant, countless thoughts turned in my heart, and said vaguely: "This... this... What are you asking about this?"
Old man Hai sighed again and said, "You are so young, so bad, hey, are you like your father or your mother?"
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "I am nothing like anyone.
Good is not good, and bad is not very bad. "
Husband Hai coughed a few times and said, "I only became an eunuch after I became an adult..."
Wei Xiaobao murmured secretly: "It turns out that to be an eunuch is to cleanse the body, and that is to cut off the urine.
He said that he knew that I hadn't been purified, if he came to purify me, it would be a good one..."
Just listen to the husband Hai continued: "I originally had a son, but unfortunately he died at the age of eight.
If I live to this day, my grandson should be as old as you.
That Mao Shiba whose surname is Mao, isn't it your father? "
Wei Xiaobao trembled: "No... No!
Mommy Spicy, when... Of course not. "
Anxious in my heart, Yangzhou dialect blurted out.
Mrs. Hai said, "I don't think so.
If you were my son and fell in the palace, even if there is great danger, I will come to rescue you. "
Wei Xiaobao smiled bitterly: "It's a pity that I don't have a good dad like you."
Mrs. Hai said: "I have taught you two sets of martial arts, the first set of'Great Catch Hand', and the second set of'Great Compassionate Chiba Hand'. I have not taught these two sets of martial arts. Naturally, you have not learned them. After learning so 15%, hehe, hehe."
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes, your old man had better teach me these two sets of kung fu.
You are the world's number one martial arts, finally someone passed it down and made a name for your old man. "
Elder Hai shook his head and said, "Where do you dare to be the four words'the world's first"
I don’t know how many martial arts are strong in the world.
My two sets of kung fu, you won't have time to learn them all in your lifetime. "
He paused and said, "You take a breath, touch your left abdomen, three inches away from your belly button, and lift it hard, and what do you see?"
Wei Xiaobao touched what he was saying and slammed it hard. He immediately hurt his heart and lungs. He couldn't help but yelled out with an "Ah". He was sweating profusely for a moment and couldn't help gasping for breath.
For nearly half a month, my left lower abdomen occasionally suffered a faint pain. It only said that my stomach was broken after eating. What's more, it only hurts for a moment and then stopped. I never paid attention to it. Unexpectedly, I aimed a little bit and lifted it. It's so awesome.
Husband Hai said gloomily, "Is it interesting?"
Wei Xiaobao cursed in his belly: "Dead old tortoise, smelly old tortoise!"
Said: "A little bit of pain, nothing interesting."
Mrs. Hai said: "You go to gamble every morning and practice martial arts with the emperor. The food is delivered before you come back.
I think this soup is not fresh enough. Every day, I take a bottle of medicine from the medicine box and add some ingredients to the soup.
Just add this little, add a lot, it's too toxic, it's not good for your body.
You are very careful, but I never drink soup. Are you not suspicious at all? "
Wei Xiaobao was terrified and said: "I... I thought you don't like soup.
You... You said that after drinking the soup, you would... Will... Cough... Cough..."
Mrs. Hai said, "I used to love soup, but there is poison in the soup. Although the amount is very light, it is always a bit dangerous to drink it every day, after a long time, isn't it?"
Wei Xiaobao said angrily: "Yes, yes!
Father, you are really good. "
Husband Hai sighed and said, "Not necessarily.
Originally, I wanted you to take the poison for another three months before releasing you from the palace, and then you would slowly have a stomachache.
First, it hurts for half an hour every day, and the pain is not very fierce. After that, the pain gets worse, and the time of pain gets longer and longer. About a year later, the pain will continue day and night, and it will hurt you His head hit the wall fiercely, biting off the meat from his hands and legs in pain. "
Having said that, he sighed: "It's a pity that my body is getting worse and worse. I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.
There is no cure for the poison in your body, but I have it after all.
Little Wawa, who on earth are you instigated to blind me by thinking of this strategy?
You said it honestly, and I will give you the antidote immediately. "
Although Wei Xiaobao was young, he knew that even if he said he would instigate the person to come out, he would never spare his life. Moreover, there was no one to instigate him at all. jump.
It turns out that you knew that I was not Xiao Guizi, so you thought of this way to torture me, haha, haha, you have been fooled by me!
Haha, haha! "
He laughed, his body moved, his right leg flexed, his right hand grabbed the handle of the dagger, and pulled it out of the scabbard very slowly, without making a sound. Even if there was a slight noise, he taught laughter It was covered up.
Mrs. Hai said, "Why did I fall for you?"
Wei Xiaobao talked nonsense. He wanted to teach him to be distracted. He wanted to talk nonsense again. He said, "There is poison in the soup. I tasted it the first day.
I discussed with Xiao Xuanzi, he said you were poisoning me..."
Elder Hai was taken aback and said, "The emperor knew about it?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Why don't you know?
It's just that I didn't even know that he was the emperor at that time. Xiao Xuanzi told me to keep quiet and watch out. When I drink the soup, I only drink it in the mouth and then vomit it in the bowl. Anyway, you can't see it. "
On the one hand, while lifting the dagger by half an inch and a half, the tip of the sword slowly pointed at the heart of Old Man Hai, thinking that if he hadn't been stabbed to death at once, even if he stabbed him, he would still be killed .
He was skeptical and sneered: "If you didn't drink any soup, why would you press your left stomach and it would hurt so much again?"
Wei Xiaobao sighed, "I think even though I spit out the soup, I didn't even rinse my mouth, but the poison was still in my stomach."
Then he moved the dagger a few inches closer.
Just listen to Mrs. Hai: "That's also very good.
Anyway, this poison can't be solved. You will be poisoned more shallowly, but the onset will be slower, and the suffering will only be greater. "
Wei Xiaobao laughed loudly. In the long laughter, he concentrated on his right arm, slammed it violently, pointed at the heart of Old Man Hai, and only waited for a knife to penetrate it, he rolled to the corner of the bed and fled from the foot of the bed.
Husband Hai suddenly felt a chill on his face, feeling slightly surprised, only knowing that the other party had already started, let alone thinking about how he did it, waved his left hand, and moved on to the pierced weapon. The right palm came out with a bang. , Slapped Wei Xiaobao into the air, broke the window pane, and fell straight into the garden outside the window. After that, he felt severe pain in his left hand and his four fingers had been severed by the dagger.
If it wasn't for Wei Xiaobao's dagger to be too cold, he hadn't had any warning signs in advance, so he would have to poke the center.
But like an ordinary sword, the difference between the two people's skill is too far, although the center of the poke, it is only a skin injury, his internal strength is everywhere, his palm is like iron, hitting the sword, flying the sword, will not hurt his palm. .
But the dagger was too sharp. After decades of hard training, the dagger could not get rid of it. Instead, he cut off four fingers silently.
But he hit Wei Xiaobao's chest firmly with a palm of his right hand. This palm cracked the stone, which is not trivial.
It was expected that Wei Xiaobao was already shattered, and he died before he flew out the window.
He sneered and said to himself: "It's so easy to die, but it's cheaper for this kid."
With certainty, he took out the Jinchuang medicine from the medicine box and applied the wound, tore off the bed sheet, wrapped his left palm, and muttered, "What kind of weapon does this kid use, and why is it so powerful?"
Enduring the severe pain in his hand, he jumped out of the window and reached out to touch the place where Wei Xiaobao fell, looking for the knife and sharp edge that he had never heard of or seen.
After groping for a long time, I didn't touch anything.
Before his eyes were blind, the garden outside the window was already familiar. He knew where there were flowers and where there were stones.
Obviously I heard that Wei Xiaobao fell beside a peony flower. The sword in this little devil's hand may have been shaken far away, but how could his body suddenly disappear?
When Wei Xiaobao hit the palm, he was suffocated with anger at the time, his chest was severely painful, and all his limbs seemed to be shattered. When he fell to the ground, he almost fainted.
He knows that life and death are at the front line at this moment. Since he failed to stab her husband to death, the old tortoise will definitely come out and chase him. He immediately climbed up and only walked two steps. The foot was soft, and he fell down. The bones fell from a slope. Go straight down.
If Mrs. Hai did not cut his fingers, the sound of Wei Xiaobao rolling down the slope would naturally not escape his ears. It was just that he was seriously injured and distraught. In addition to dreaming, he would never have imagined that this little devil would not die if he was hit by his palm. , But never thought of the reason.
The slope was so long that Wei Xiaobao rolled straight out for more than ten feet before stopping.
He struggled to stand up and walked away slowly, his muscles and bones ached. Fortunately, the dagger was still in his hand. He secretly rejoiced: "Just now the old tortoise hit me out of the window. I didn't insert the dagger into my body. I was really lucky."
Inserting the dagger into the boot shaft, I thought: "The diorama has been dismantled. Since the old turtle knows that I am a fake, I can't live in the palace anymore.
It's a pity that four hundred fifty thousand taels of silver has become an empty joy.
His grandma's, how can a person have such good luck, a windfall is 450,000 taels?
All in all, Lao Tzu had a net worth of 450,000 taels of silver, but Lao Tzu's methods were generous and he spent all his energy overnight.
Are you good enough? "
Bragging in my belly, I can't help feeling proud.
I thought again: "The little palace lady is still waiting for me. Anyway, she can't leave the palace in the middle of the night, so I will look at her, oh..."
He touched the paper box in his arms, already crushed to a mess, and said in his heart: "I'll show it to her, so she won't worry about waiting.
Just say that I dropped it and crushed the candied candies into a pile of cow dung, but this pile of cow dung is sweet and fragrant, and it tastes pretty good.
Haha, Mom Spicy, have you eaten sweet and fragrant cow dung?
I have eaten it. "
He thought about it and thought it was fun. He quickened his pace and walked towards the Ci Ning Palace where the Queen Mother was staying. He only walked a few steps faster, and his chest suddenly hurt, so he slowed down again.
Coming to the outside of Ci Ning Palace, seeing the palace gate closed, I thought: "Oops, but I didn't expect this gate to be closed, so how do I get in?"
Just ignoring the matter, the palace gate suddenly pushed open silently, a little girl poked her head out, and it was clear from the moonlight that it was Rui Chu.
Seeing her smiling and waving, Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and flashed past the door gently.
Rui Chu closed the door again and whispered in his ear: "I'm afraid you won't be able to get in. I have been waiting here for a long time."
Wei Xiaobao also whispered: "I'm late.
I stumbled on a smelly and hard old tortoise and fell. "
Rui Chu said, "Is there a big turtle in the garden?
I haven't seen it before.
You... Have you ever fallen? "
Wei Xiaobao walked up in a hurry, and the pain on his body could be tolerated. Asking Rui Chu this way, he felt pain everywhere in his body and couldn't help but snorted.
Rui Chu grabbed his hand and asked in a low voice, "Where did the fall hurt?"
Wei Xiaobao was about to answer. Suddenly, he saw a dark shadow passing by and raised his head, but he saw a huge eagle flying in from the wall and gently landing.
He was taken aback and almost uttered a cry of horror. Under the moonlight, he saw the great eagle stand up. It turned out that it was not the great eagle, but he was alone.
This person is thin, bent over and back, but who is not the husband?
Rui Chu originally faced him and didn't see her husband coming in, but saw Wei Xiaobao turning his head and staring, his face was full of horror, and he turned around.
Wei Xiaobao peeked at her left hand and pressed her lips with great effort to prevent her from making any noise. He shook his right hand violently to signal not to make a sound.
Rui Chu nodded.
Only then did Wei Xiaobao slowly let go of his left hand and looked at her husband Hai intently.
I saw her husband standing stiff, as if listening to the movement, after a while, he walked slowly forward.
Seeing that he was not walking towards him, Wei Xiaobao secretly breathed a sigh of relief, and said in his heart: "The old tortoise is so powerful, although his eyes are blind, he can actually chase here."
I thought: "As long as I and this little palace lady don't make any noise, the old turtle will not find me."
Husband Hai took a few steps forward, suddenly jumped up, fell in front of Wei Xiaobao, peeked with his left hand, and crossed Rui Chu's neck.
Rui Chu yelled "Ah", but his throat was stuck and the yell was low and stuffy.
Wei Xiaobao's thoughts teleported: "The old tortoise is looking for me, not the little palace lady, and won't kill her."
At this time, he was only two feet away from her husband, so scared that he almost peeed, but didn't move, knowing that as long as he moved a finger, he would hear it.
Husband Hai whispered: "Don't make any noise!
If you are not obedient, you will be stuck.
Answer my words gently.
who are you?"
Rui Chu whispered: "I... I..."
Husband Hai stretched out his right hand, touched the top of her head, touched her cheek again, and said, "You are a little palace lady, aren't you?"
Rui Chu said: "Yes, yes!"
Mrs. Hai said, "What are you doing here in the middle of the night?"
Rui Chu said: "I... I am playing here!"
A faint smile appeared on the face of Old Man Hai. From the bleak moonlight, he looked even more gloomy and terrifying, and asked, "Who else is here?"
Turned his head to listen.
Shi Cairui didn't know how to hold her breath, and breathed heavily in panic, telling her husband Hai where she was standing.
Although Wei Xiaobao was close to him, he breathed so little that he didn't notice it for a while.
Wei Xiaobao wanted to make a gesture to tell her to stop talking, but he dared not move his arm.
Fortunately, Rui Chu was so obsessed that he realized that his eyes were blind, and said, "No... No more."
Mrs. Hai said: "Where does the empress dowager live?
You take me to see her."
Rui Chu said in surprise: "Father-in-law, you... Don't tell the queen mother, next time... next time I won't dare anymore."
She only said that the old eunuch had caught herself and was going to report to the queen mother.
Mrs. Hai said: "It's useless to ask.
If you don't take me, you will be killed immediately."
With a slight effort on his hand, Rui Chu was suffocated with qi, and a small face suddenly swelled and flushed.
In panic, Wei Xiaobao finally peeed, dripping from his crotch drop by drop. Fortunately, husband Hai didn't pay attention. Even if he heard it, Rui Chu was so scared to pee.
Husband Hai slowly released his left hand and whispered: "Take me quickly."
Rui Chu had no choice but to say: "Good!"
He glanced sideways at Wei Xiaobao, the expression on his face motioned him to go quickly, and he would never allow him to come out, and whispered: "The Queen Mother's palace is over there!"
Move slowly.
Her left hand still grabbed her throat and walked side by side with her.
Wei Xiaobao thought: "The old turtle must have told the Queen Mother that I am a pretending little eunuch, Xiao Guizi was killed for me, and his own eyes were blinded to me, and the Queen Mother must be arrested immediately.
Why didn't he report to the emperor?
Yes, he knows that the emperor is good to me, and most of the complaints won't be filed.
Then... What's the matter?
I have to escape from the palace immediately.
Oh, no, at this time the palace gate is closed early, how can you escape?
As long as a few moments passed, the queen mother gave orders, and it was even more difficult to fly."
