Later, we relived the great friendship in the hotel and talked about various things.
I talked about the various possibilities back then, talked about the materials I wrote, and talked about my little monk.
As soon as the thing heard others talk about it, it became agitated and moved stupidly.
So I concluded that people wanted to hammer us off at that time, but there was no hammer.
I am still as tough as ever.
For the sake of great friendship, I can still run three laps on the street naked.
As a person, I have never known to face.
Anyway, it was my golden age.
Although I was considered a hooligan.
I know many people there, including the tramp driving the tramp, the old Jingpo on the mountain and so on.
Everyone knows Wang Er who can repair watches.
They and I drank that two cents a pound of wine by the fire, and we could drink a lot.
I am very popular with them.
In addition to these people, the pigs in the pig farm also like me, because when I feed the pigs, there are three times more chaff in the pig food than usual.
Then I quarreled with the chief secretary, and I said, we pigs must be full.
I carry a lot of great friendships, which I want to give to everyone.
Because they didn't want it, they all vented on Chen Qingyang.
Chen Qingyang and I had a great friendship in the hotel, which was entertaining.
I withdrew once in the middle and saw blood stains on the little monk.
She said, as she gets older, the inside is a little thin, so don't try so hard.
She also said that after staying in the south for a long time, her hands would split when she reached the north.
But the quality of clam oil has dropped, so it doesn't matter if you put it on your hands.
After saying these words, she took out a small bottle of glycerin and put it on the little monk.
Then he was on Dun, speaking easily.
I was like a piece of wood to be solved, lying between her separated legs.
Chen Qingyang's face has many shallow wrinkles, which look like golden lines under the light.
I kissed her on the mouth, and she didn't object.
This means that her lips are soft and parted.
She didn't let me kiss her lips before, let me kiss her chin and neck.
She said that this stimulates sexual desire.
Then continue to talk about the past.
Chen Qingyang said that it was also her golden age.
Although she is called a broken shoe, she is innocent.
She is still innocent.
After hearing this, I laughed.
But she said, what we are doing is not a sin.
We had a great friendship. We fled together, went on a business trip together, and met again after twenty years. Of course she had to spread her legs and let me in.
So even if it was a sin, she didn't know where it was.
More importantly, she knew nothing about this evil.
Then she became short of breath again.
Her face turned red, her legs clamped me tightly, her body tightened under me, and her depressed cry passed through her teeth again and again, and it took a long time to relax.
At this time she said it was not bad.
After it was not bad, she said it was not a sin.
Because she is like Socrates and knows nothing about everything.
Although he lived for more than 40 years, there was still a wonderful new world before him.
She didn't know why she was sent to that desolate place in Yunnan, and she didn't know why she was sent back.
I don't know why she is said to be a broken shoe and put her on stage to fight, and I don't know why she is said to be a broken shoe, and the written materials are extracted again.
There have been various explanations of these things, but none of them can be understood by her.
She is so ignorant, so she is innocent.
It is written in all legal books.
Chen Qingyang said that people live in the world to endure torture until death.
With this in mind, everything can be calm.
To explain how she had such an insight, everything must be traced back to the time when I came back from the hospital and passed through the mountains from her.
I asked her to see me, she kept hesitating.
When she made up her mind, she walked through the hot wind at noon and came to the front of my thatched house. At that moment, she had many beautiful imaginations in her heart.
When she entered the thatched house, she saw my little monk upright, like an ugly instrument of torture.
At that time she screamed and gave up all hope.
Chen Qingyang said that one winter day more than 20 years ago, she went to the yard.
Wearing a cotton-padded coat at that time, she climbed the threshold of the courtyard with difficulty.
Suddenly a grain of sand got into her eyes, it hurt so much, the cold wind cut her face like that, tears kept streaming.
She felt unbearable and immediately burst into tears, trying to wake up in a small bed.
This is an inherent habit, deeply rooted.
To cry aloud from one dream to another is a luxury that everyone has.
Chen Qingyang said that when she went to find me, gold flies were flying in the woods.
The wind blows from all directions, through the placket, and climbs onto the body.
The place I stayed in was an empty mountain.
The hot sunlight fell from the zenith like fragments of mica.
Under a thin white coat, she was completely stripped.
At that time, she also had many extravagant hopes in her heart.
In any case, it was her golden age, although she was called a broken shoe at that time.
Chen Qingyang said that when she was looking for me in the mountains, she climbed over the bare hills.
The wind blew in from under her clothes and passed through her sexually sensitive zone. At that time, the sexual desire she felt was as uncertain as the wind.
It spreads out like a phoenix on the mountain.
She thought of our great friendship, and remembered me hurrying down the mountain.
She still remembered that I had long tousled hair and looked straight at her when I argued that she was a torn shoe.
She feels need of me, we can merge and become one male and female.
Just like when she was young, she climbed out of the threshold and felt the wind outside.
The sky is so blue, the sun is so bright, and there are pigeons flying in the sky.
The sound of the pigeon whistle is unforgettable for life.
She wanted to talk to me at this time, just as she longed to be one with the outside world and melt into the world.
If she was the only person in the world, it would be too lonely.
Chen Qingyang said that when she went to my little thatched house, she thought of everything except the little monk.
That thing is so ugly that it doesn't deserve to appear in a dream.
At that time, Chen Qingyang wanted to cry too much, but couldn't cry, as if someone pinched his throat.
This is the so-called truth.
To be true is to be unable to wake up.
At that moment, she finally understood what was in the world, and then she made up her mind in the next moment, stepped forward and accepted the destruction, feeling extremely happy.
Chen Qingyang also said that at that moment, she remembered the moment of crying on the threshold.
She cried and cried at that time, always crying.
And the pain doesn't mean any reduction.
She cried for a long time and never gave up.
She didn't give up until she faced the little monk twenty years later.
This is not the first time she has faced a young monk.
But before, she didn't believe there was such a thing in the world.
Chen Qingyang said that when she faced this ugly thing, she thought of great friendship.
There is a female classmate in the university who looks ugly and looks like a ghost (or rather, looks like this), but she has to sleep in the same bed with her.
Not only that, but when the night is deep in silence, he will kiss her on the mouth and touch her breasts.
To be honest, she has no hobbies in this area.
But for the sake of friendship, she held back.
Now that this thing flares its teeth and claws, all it requires is the same thing.
Just let it taste as you wish, and it's also a way to make friends.
So she stepped forward and buried its ugliness deeply, feeling extremely happy.
Chen Qingyang said that by then she still believed that she was innocent.
Even until she and I fled into the mountains, we had a great friendship almost every day.
She said that this did not explain how bad she was, because she didn't know why my little monk and I were doing this.
She did this for great friendship, and great friendship is a promise.
Trustworthiness is definitely not a sin.
She promised to help me, and in all aspects.
But I hit her ass twice in the deep mountains, completely tarnishing her innocence.
I wrote for a long time to explain the materials, and the leader said that the explanation is not thorough, and I must continue to explain.
So I thought that the rest of my life would be spent in confession.
Finally, Chen Qingyang wrote a confession material, but he didn't show it to me, so he handed it to the PICC.
Since then, we have not been asked to write materials.
Not only that, but it doesn't tell us to travel on business.
Not only that, Chen Qingyang also became indifferent to me.
After a period of time without emotion, I went back to the mainland by myself.
I can't guess what she wrote.
When I returned from Yunnan, I lost everything: my gun, my knife, and my tools. There was only one more thing, that is, my portfolio was bulging.
There are materials written by myself. From then on, no matter where I go, people will know that I am a hooligan.
The benefit is that he will return to the city earlier than others, but itâ€™s no good to come back earlier, and get the Beijing suburbs to jump in.
When I arrived in Yunnan, I brought a lot of tools, including table holders and small vise.
In addition to fitter furniture, there is also a set of watch repair tools.
When I lived on the hill behind Daddy Liu, I used it to show people watches.
Although the empty mountain was silent, some caravans passed there.
Someone asked me to appraise the smuggling table, and I said it was worth as much as it was worth.
Of course not for nothing.
So I live very well in the mountains.
If it doesn't come down, it is now a million yuan household.
As for the double-barreled shotgun, it is also a treasure.
It turns out that the old sleeves of the local carbine are not uncommon, but I have never seen that thing.
The bobbin is so thick and there are two more tubes. I can bluff people with it.
Otherwise, they would have snatched us.
I, especially Daddy Liu, will not be robbed, I am afraid they will take Chen Qingyang away.
As for my knife, it is always tied to a large leather belt.
The large leather belt was tied to Chen Qingyang's waist.
Sleeping and sex are not taken off.
She feels very stylish with a knife.
So this knife can be said to belong to Chen Qingyang.
I have already said the guns and knives, but the PICC is going to leave.
I didn't bring my tools down when I went down the mountain, so I put them on the mountain, and then I would run up the mountain when the preparation was not smooth.
When I came back, I was in a hurry and didn't care to get it, so I became a complete pauper.
I told Chen Qingyang that I couldn't figure out what she wrote in the last account.
She said that she can't tell me now.
To tell me about this, I can only wait until the time to break up.
She was going back to Shanghai the next day, and she asked me to take her to the station.
Chen Qingyang is different from me in all aspects.
After dawn, she took a cold shower (there was no hot water), and she dressed it.
From underwear to outerwear, she is a fragrant lady.
And I am an authentic hooligan from underwear to outerwear.
No wonder people pulled out her confession materials, and refused to pull out mine.
= This means that her ruptured hymen has grown.
As for me, I have never grown longer than that.
In addition, I also committed the crime of instigation. We made a lot of mistakes together. Since she knew nothing about the crime, I had to count them all on my account.
We checked out and went to the street.
At this time, I thought that her account must be extremely obscene.
The people who read the materials are hard-hearted, and their level is so high that they can make people unable to bear it. How good is it?
Chen Qingyang said that nothing was written in that material, only her true sins.
Chen Qingyang said that her true sins were on Qingping Mountain.
She was put on my shoulders, wearing a skirt that wrapped her legs tightly, and her hair was hanging down to my waist.
White clouds in the sky hurried, and there were only two of us in the mountains.
I just hit her ass twice, it was very heavy, and the feeling of burning fire was drifting away.
After the fight, I didn't care about other things and continued to climb the mountain.
Chen Qingyang said that she felt weak at that moment and she collapsed and hung on my shoulder.
At that moment, she felt like an ivy around the tree, and the little bird surrounded the tree.
She didn't want to pay attention to other things anymore, and forgot everything at that moment.
At that moment she fell in love with me, and this matter can never be changed.
At the station, Chen Qingyang said that when this material was handed in, the head of the group picked it up and looked at it.
After reading it, my face is red, just like your little monk.
Later, the people who saw her confession materials were blushing, like little monks.
Later, the people from the People's Insurance Group looked for her several times and asked her to take it back and rewrite it, but she said that this was the real situation and could not change a word.
They had to put this thing in our portfolio.
Chen Qingyang said that admitting this is equivalent to admitting all sins.
In the People's Insurance Group, they showed her all kinds of confessions, just to make her understand that no one would write confessions like that.
But she wanted to write like this.
She said that the reason why she wanted to write this thing last was because it was worse than everything she had done.
She confessed to spreading her legs before, and now she adds that she does these things because she likes them.
Having done this is very different from liking it.
The former should be on a business trip, and the latter should be divided into pieces.
But no one had the right to divide us into five horses, so we had to let us go.
After Chen Qingyang told me this, the train drove away.
I never saw her again.
