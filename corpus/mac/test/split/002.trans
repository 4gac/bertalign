In the end, we were locked up and wrote a long time to explain materials.
At first I wrote this:
I have an improper relationship with Chen Qingyang.
this is all.
The above said, this is too simple to write, ask me to rewrite.
Later I wrote that I had an improper relationship with Chen Qingyang. I had fucked her many times, and she was happy to let me do it.
As mentioned above, such writing lacks details.
Later, such details were added:
The fortieth time we had sex illegally, the place was in the thatched house I secretly built on the mountain.
That day was either lunar fifteenth or lunar sixteenth, anyway the moon was very bright.
Chen Qingyang was sitting on the bamboo bed, and the moonlight came in through the door and shone on her.
I was standing on the ground, and she bound my waist with her legs.
We also talked a few words, I said that her breasts are not only round, but also very long. The navel is not only round but also very shallow.
These are all good.
She said yes, I don't know.
Then the moonlight moved away, I lighted a cigarette, she took it halfway through, and then took a few puffs.
She also pinched my nose, because there is a local saying that the nose of virgins is very hard, and the nose of those who are going to die is very soft.
These days she lay lazily on the bed, leaning against the bamboo wall.
The rest of the time she hugged me like an Australian koala, blowing heat on my face.
Finally the moon came in through the window opposite the door.
At this time I separated from her.
But I wrote these materials, not for military representatives.
He was no longer a military representative at that time, and he was demobilized and went home.
It doesn't matter whether he represents or not. Anyway, if we make a mistake like ours, we always have to write an explanation.
Later, I had a good relationship with the head of personnel of our school.
He said that the biggest advantage of being a personnel cadre is that you can see the explanatory materials written by others.
I think what he said includes the explanatory materials I wrote.
I think my presentation materials are the most literary.
Because I lived in a guest house when I wrote these materials, there was nothing else to do, just like a professional writer.
I ran away at night.
That morning, I asked the Chief Secretary for leave to buy toothpaste in Jingkan Town.
I am under the leadership of the Chief Secretary, who also has the task of monitoring me.
He should watch me anytime, anywhere, but I disappeared when it got dark.
In the morning I brought him many sour pagodas, all of which are good.
You can't eat the sour pagodas on the plain because there is a colony of ants.
Only the sour pagoda in the mountains is free of ants.
The Chief Secretary said that his personal relationship with me is not bad, and the military representative is not there.
He can allow me to buy toothpaste.
But the Chief Secretary also said that military representatives will come back at any time.
If I were not there when he came back, the Chief Secretary could not cover me.
I got out of the team, climbed the back hill of the 15th team, took a lens and shook Chen Qingyang's rear window.
After a while, she came up to the mountain and said that the first two days she was being watched so closely that she could not get out.
And these days she has menstruation again.
She said it was okay, let's do it.
I said that would not work.
She insisted on giving me two hundred yuan when we broke up.
At first I didn't want it, but later I accepted it.
Later, Chen Qingyang told me that she was not watched very closely for the first two days, and then she did not have a period.
In fact, the 15th team didn't care about her at all.
People there are accustomed to talking about people who are not broken shoes as broken shoes, and let go of really broken shoes.
The reason she refused to come up the mountain and kept me waiting for several days was because she was tired of the matter.
She always has to wait until she is in a good mood to have sex, not as long as she has sex.
Of course, after doing this, she was not without guilt.
So she gave me two hundred yuan.
I think since she has two hundred dollars to spend, I will spend it for her.
So I took the money to Jingkan Town and bought a double-barreled shotgun.
Later, I wrote about the material, and the double-barreled shotgun was also a theme.
People suspect that I will kill someone if I take it.
In fact, if you want to kill someone, you can use a two-hundred-dollar double-barreled shotgun and a forty-dollar copper gun.
That kind of gun is used to shoot wild ducks by the water, it is not practical in the mountains, and it sinks like a dead person.
When I arrived on Jingkan Street that day, it was already in the afternoon, and it was not a day to drive the street, so there was only one empty dirt road and a few empty state-owned stores.
There is a salesperson dozing off in the shop, and there are many flies flying.
"Lu Guo Luhu" was written on the shelf, and aluminum pots and pots were placed.
I chatted with the Jiaodong salesperson for a while, and she asked me to look in the warehouse.
There I saw the shotgun from Shanghai, and bought it regardless of the fact that it had not been sold for two years.
In the evening, I took it to the river for a trial release and killed a heron.
At this time, the military representative came back from the field and was surprised to see a gun in my hand.
He nagged that this matter was not right, and no one could have a gun in his hand.
You should talk to the team and confiscated Wang Er's gun.
When I heard this, I almost shot him in the stomach.
If he was hit, he would probably be killed.
I won't survive that much.
On the way back from Jingkan to the team that afternoon, I waded through the fields and stood in rice trees for a while.
I saw many locusts swimming out like fish and stinging on my legs.
At that time, I was shirtless, my clothes were covered with a lot of brown sugar stuffed buns (the restaurant in the town only sells this kind of food), double-handed buns and a gun on my back.
So I didn't care about those locusts either.
When I got to the shore, I grabbed them one by one and burned them to death.
They burned so soft and foamy.
Suddenly I felt very annoyed and tired, unlike a twenty-one year old.
I think it will get old soon if this continues.
Then I met Ledu.
He told me that they had caught all the fish in that river fork.
My share has been dried into dried fish and is in his sister's hands.
His sister told me to go.
His sister and I are also very familiar, she is a pretty black girl.
I said I can't go right now.
I gave Ledu all the buns and asked him to send me a letter to the 15th team, telling Chen Qingyang that I bought a gun with the money she gave me.
Ledu went to the 15th team and told Chen Qingyang what she had said. She was very scared and felt that I would kill the military representative.
This idea is not unreasonable. In the evening, I wanted to shoot the military representative.
In the evening, I was playing a heron by the river and ran into a military representative.
As usual, I didn't say a word, he chatted endlessly.
I was very angry, because it has been more than half a month, and he kept chattering to me, saying the same thing: I am very bad and need to be reformed.
I can't relax for a moment.
I have listened to this for a lifetime, and I have never been as hot as that night.
Later, he said that he had a great news today that he wanted to announce to everyone.
But he didn't say what it was, only that my "stinky bitch" Chen Qingyang and I would have a hard time in the future.
I was particularly annoyed by this, and wanted to choke him to death on the spot, and wanted to hear what good news he said before starting.
He didn't say it, he kept selling it, he only said something that didn't matter, and he said it after he was in the team. Come to the meeting tonight, and I will announce it at the meeting.
I didn't attend the meeting in the evening. I packed my things in the house and prepared to flee up the mountain.
I think something big must have happened, so that the military representative had a good way to clean up Chen Qingyang and me. As for what I did not figure out, it was difficult to guess what happened that year.
I even thought that maybe China has restored the monarchy, and the military representative has become the chieftain here.
He can hammer me off and take Chen Qingyang as a concubine.
When I was ready to go out, I knew it was not that serious.
Because of the slogans being shouted at the conference, I could hear them in the room.
It turned out that this place will be transformed from a state-owned farm into a military reclamation corps.
The military representative may want to be a regiment leader.
In any case, he could not castrate me, nor could he take Chen Qingyang away.
I hesitated for a few minutes, put the loaded things on my shoulders, and used a machete to chop everything in the house, and wrote on the wall with charcoal: "XXX (name of the military representative), fuck you! "
Then he went out and went up the mountain.
This is how I escaped from Team 14.
I also wrote these experiences in the presentation materials.
In a nutshell, it looks like this:
I have a private grudge with the military representative. This private grudge has two aspects:
First, I told the consolation group that I had been knocked out, and it was very shameful to call the military representative. Second, I was jealous, so he kept fixing me.
When he was about to become regiment leader, I felt unbearable and fled to the mountain.
I still think this is the reason I fled to the mountain.
But people said that the military representative did not become the regiment commander at all, and the reason for my escape cannot be established.
Therefore, people say that such explanations are not credible.
The credible material should be that Chen Qingyang and I have an affair.
As the saying goes, we can do whatever we want.
There is some truth to this, but when I escaped from the team, I didn't plan to find Chen Qingyang, so I decided to leave.
When I walked to the edge of the mountain, I thought, anyway, Chen is a friend of mine and should go to say goodbye.
Who knows Chen Qingyang said that she wants to run away with me.
She also said that if she didn't join in such things, wouldn't the great friendship feed the dog?
So she hurriedly packed up some things and went with me.
If there were no things she and she packed up, I would definitely die on the mountain.
There are a lot of malaria medicines in those things, and a lot of large condoms.
After Chen Qingyang and I escaped up the mountain, the farm panicked for a while.
They thought we went to Myanmar.
It was not good for anyone to spread the incident, so I didn't report it to the top, but wanted Wang Er and Chen Qingyang inside the farm.
We are very recognizable, and we also brought a double-barreled shotgun that no one else has. It is easy to be spotted, but no one has found us.
It was not until half a year later that we came back to the farm on our own and returned to our respective teams. It took more than a month before we were called by the PICC to write an explanation.
It was also because we had a fleeting disadvantage. We encountered a movement and were exposed.
The house of the People's Insurance Group is a lonely adobe house at the intersection of the site.
You can see it from far away because it is whitewashed and because it is on a high post.
Everyone rushed to the field and saw the house from afar.
It is surrounded by a sisal ground. The sisal is always green and the soil under the sisal is always bright red.
I explained the problem there and explained everything.
We went up the mountain and planted corn on the mountain after the 15th team. The soil was not good and half of the corn did not emerge.
We left, walked day and night, looking for another place to settle.
Finally, I remembered that there was a waste water mill on the mountain, where there was a large area of ​​good land abandoned.
Daddy Liu who ran out of Leper Village lived in the water roller.
No one went there, only Chen Qingyang remembered that he was a doctor once and went to see it once.
We finally went to Daddy Liu and lived in the mountain valley behind Shui Nian. Chen Qingyang treated Daddy Liu for medical treatment, and I planted Daddy Liu.
After some time, I rushed to Qingping and ran into classmates.
They said that the military representative was transferred and no one remembered us.
We will come back.
The whole thing is like this.
I stayed in the PICC for a long time.
For a while, the atmosphere was okay. People said that the problem is clear and you are ready to write materials.
Then suddenly it became serious again, suspecting that we went abroad, colluded with hostile forces, and took the task back.
So they called Chen Qingyang to the People's Insurance Team for strict interrogation.
When I asked her, I looked out the window.
There are many clouds in the sky.
I was told to confess to illegally crossing the border.
In fact, I am not innocent in this matter.
I have indeed been overseas.
I once dressed up as an old Dai and drove across the street across the street.
I bought some matches and salt there.
But there is no need to say it.
Don’t say anything you don’t need to say.
Later, I brought people from the People's Insurance Group to the place where we lived to investigate.
The little thatched house I built on the hill behind the 15th team has leaked, and the cornfield has attracted many birds.
There are a lot of used condoms behind the thatched house, which is an iron proof that we have lived here.
The locals do not like condoms, saying that they block the communication between Yin and Yang and make people weaker day by day.
In fact, the local condom is better than any one I have used later.
That is 100% natural rubber.
Later, I refused to take them to see those places. Anyway, I said I didn't go abroad, they didn't believe it.
Take them to see, they still don't believe it.
Don't do things you don't need to do.
I don't say a word all day.
Chen Qingyang also said nothing.
The person inquiring about the case was still asking at first, but then he didn't bother to say anything.
Many old Dai and Lao Jingpo walked by with fresh fruits and vegetables in the street, and fewer and fewer people asked questions.
In the end there was only one person left.
He also wanted to drive the streets, but before letting us go back, let us stay here unattended, which was not in compliance with the regulations.
He went to the door and called someone to stop the passing sister.
But people often refused to stand still, but accelerated their pace.
Seeing this, we laughed.
The comrades of the People's Insurance Group finally stopped a sister-in-law.
Chen Qingyang stood up, straightened his hair, folded his shirt collar, and turned his back.
The sister-in-law tied her up, tied her hands tightly, and then buckled the rope around her neck and arms.
The sister-in-law said sorry, I can't tie people.
The comrades of the People's Insurance Group said, it's okay.
Then he tied me up again, let us sit back to back on two chairs, tied one with a rope, and then he locked the door and went to the market.
After a long time, he came back, took something from the desk, and asked: Do you want to go to the toilet?
It's still early, I'll be back to release you later.
Then go out again.
When he finally came to let us go, Chen Qingyang moved his fingers, tidyed up his hair, and dusted off the dust on his body. We went back to the guest house.
We go to the People's Insurance Team every day, and we are tied up every day when we get to the streets. Besides, we sometimes go to the teams to fight with others.
They also repeatedly threatened to adopt other dictatorship methods against us—this is how we are being censored.
Later, people didn't doubt that we had gone abroad, and began to be more polite to her, often calling her to the hospital to see the chief of staff for prostatitis.
At that time, a large number of veteran cadres from the army came to our farm, and many of them had prostatitis.
After investigation, it was discovered that only Chen Qingyang knew that there was a prostate on his body.
The comrades of the People's Insurance Group said that we should explain the relationship between men and women.
I said, how did you know that we have problems with men and women?
Did you see that?
They said, then you just confess the problem of speculation.
I said again, how did you know that I had a problem with speculation?
They said, then you still have to confess the issue of surrendering to the enemy.
Anyway, you have to confess the problem, and discuss what to confess.
If I don't explain anything, I won't let you go.
After discussing with Chen Qingyang, I decided to explain the relationship between men and women.
She said that she was not afraid to confess what she did.
So I wrote the explanatory materials like a writer.
The first thing I told was about the night that I ran up the mountain.
After writing it several times, I finally wrote that Chen Qingyang is like a koala bear.
She admitted that she was very excited that day, indeed she looked like a koala bear.
Because she finally had the opportunity to practice her great friendship.
So she wrapped her legs around my waist, grabbed my shoulders with her hands, and imagined me like a big tree, and tried to climb it several times.
Later I saw Chen Qingyang again, it was in the 90s.
She said that she was divorced and lived in Shanghai with her daughter and went to Beijing on business.
When I arrived in Beijing, I thought that Wang Er was here, maybe I could see him.
In the end, I really saw me at the Longtan Lake Temple Fair.
I'm still the same, hungry tattoos into my mouth, black green under my eyes, passing through the cotton-padded jacket, squatting on the ground and eating unremarkable stew and boiled on fire.
The only difference from the past is that the hands were browned with nitric acid.
Chen Qingyang's appearance has changed a lot. She is wearing a thin woolen coat, a plaid skirt, high-heeled leather boots, and gold glasses. She is like a public relations clerk in a company. She doesn't call me, and I will never recognize it.
So I thought that everyone has their own essence, put it in the right place to shine.
My nature is a kind of rogue bandit, and now I am a city citizen and a school teacher.
Chen Qingyang said that her daughter is already in her sophomore year, and she recently learned about us and wanted to see me.
The cause of this is this:
The hospital wanted to promote her and found that there was still a bunch of things in her file.
After discussion by the leaders, the materials deemed to be the whole person during the Cultural Revolution should be withdrawn.
So he sent someone to Yunnan to transfer, spent 10,000 yuan on travel expenses, and finally took it out.
Because I wrote it, return it to me.
She took it home and put it there, but her daughter saw it.
The daughter said, "Wow, you guys made me like that!"
Actually, I have nothing to do with her daughter.
When her daughter was born, I had already left Yunnan.
Chen Qingyang explained the same way, but the girl said that I can put the semen in a test tube and send it to Yunnan for artificial insemination by Chen Qingyang.
In her original words: You two bastards can't do anything.
On the first night we escaped into the mountains, Chen Qingyang was very excited.
When I fell asleep at dawn, she called me up again, when heavy fog was streaming in through the cracks in the wall.
She asked me to do it again, don't wear it.
She is going to give birth to a litter of cubs, and she will be here in a few years.
At the same time, she grabbed the nipple and pulled it down to show the droop.
I don't think drooping is good-looking, so let's think of a way, don't call it drooping.
So I still wear that fish.
She lost interest in this matter later.
Later, when I met Chen Qingyang again, I asked, how is it, is it drooping?
She said no, she was in a mess.
Do you want to see how drooping it is.
I saw it later, and I was not confused.
But she said that sooner or later it will be a mess, and there is no other way out.
I wrote this explanatory material and handed it in. Leaders appreciate it.
A big man, either the chief of staff of the regiment or the political commissar, received us and said that we had a good attitude.
Leaders believe that we have not surrendered to the enemy.
The main task in the future is to explain the relationship between men and women.
If we explain well, let us get married.
But we don't want to get married.
Later, he said that I was transferred back to the mainland if I had a good account.
Chen Qingyang can also be transferred to a higher-level hospital.
So I wrote the materials in the guest house for more than a month. No one disturbed me except for business trips. I wrote it on carbon paper. The original is mine and the copy is hers.
We have exactly the same explanation material.
Later, the comrades of the People's Insurance Group asked me to discuss it and said that it was going to hold a big fight.
All people who have been censored in the People's Insurance Group must participate, including speculators, corrupt criminals, and various bad guys.
We should have belonged to the same category, but the group leader said that we are young and have a good attitude in dealing with problems, so we can not participate.
But some people climbed on us and said that they were all censored. Why didn't they participate.
The PICC is also difficult to handle.
So we must participate.
The final decision is to do the work and mobilize us to participate.
It is said that after being criticized and fighting, there is a shock in my mind, and I can make fewer mistakes in the future.
Since there are such benefits, why not participate.
On the day of the meeting, thousands of people came to the field and nearby production teams.
We stood on the stage with many other people.
After waiting for a long time and listening to several critical drafts, it was our turn to commit the second crime, Wang Chen.
It turns out that our problem is ideological fornication and corrupt style. In order to avoid ideological reform, we fled to the mountains.
Later, inspired by the party's policy, he went down the mountain and abandoned the secret to the public.
Hearing this kind of evaluation, we were excited and shouted with everyone: Down with Wang Er!
Down with Chen Qingyang!
After fighting this one, we'll be fine.
But you still have to write an explanation, because the leadership of the regiment wants to see it.
On the mountain behind the 15th team, Chen Qingyang was very impulsive once and wanted to give birth to a bunch of cubs. I didn't want it.
Later, I thought, I might as well give birth, and then I told her, but she refused to give birth.
And she always understood me to do that.
She said that it doesn't matter if you want to do it.
I think it's purely for me, it's too selfish, so I rarely do it.
Besides, it is very tiring to open up wasteland and has no energy to do it.
All I can tell is touching her breasts while resting on the ground.
When opening up wasteland in the dry season, there was hot wind everywhere, there was no sweat on my body, but my muscles were dry and painful.
When it's hottest, you can only sleep under the tree.
Pillow on the bamboo tube, sleep on the brown leather coat.
I wonder why no one asked me to confess to Yin Yi.
Those are labor protection supplies for the farm, which are very expensive.
I brought two pieces into the mountain, one was mine and the other was taken from someone else's door.
I didn't get one back.
Until I left Yunnan, no one asked me to return the clothes.
When we were resting on the ground, Chen Qingyang covered his face with the hat, opened the collar of his shirt, and fell asleep immediately.
I put my hand in, there is a beautiful round feeling.
Later, I unbuttoned a few more and saw that her skin was light red.
Although she always wears clothes to work, the sun shines through the thin cloth.
As for me, I am always shirtless, already dark as a ghost.
Chen Qingyang's breasts are very strong, and it feels like this when lying down.
But other places are very slim.
After more than 20 years, the appearance hasn't changed much, but the nipples have become a little big and black.
She said it was a sin by her daughter.
The child was just born, like a pink pig, closed his eyes and ate at her place. He kept eating her as an old lady, but grew up into a beautiful girl, just like she was back then.
As he got older, Chen Qingyang became a little sensitive.
I revisited the old relationship with her in the hotel. When it comes to such topics, she feels panic.
That was not the case back then.
At that time, I wrote about her breasts in the confession materials, and I still hesitated.
She said, just write like that.
I said, so you are exposed.
She said, "I'm not afraid of being exposed!"
She also said that it grew like this naturally, and it wasn't that she had made a mess.
As for what others have heard of, it is not her problem.
It took me so many years to realize that Chen Qingyang is my ex-wife.
After explaining the problem, they asked us to get married.
I don't think it is necessary anymore.
However, the leaders said that not getting married would have a bad effect, and they had to be asked to register.
Marriage was registered in the morning and divorced in the afternoon.
I don't think it counts.
People who make trouble, they forgot to send the marriage certificate back.
As a result, Chen Qingyang kept one.
We registered a double room with the torn paper we issued 20 years ago.
If there is no such thing, you are not allowed to live in a house.
Not like this twenty years ago.
Twenty years ago, they let us live in a house to write confession materials, and there was no such thing at the time.
I wrote about our living on the back mountain.
The leaders of the regiment asked the people in the People's Insurance Group to tell you not to talk too much about minor issues, and to explain to the next case.
After hearing this, I became angry: Mom, is this a case?
Chen Qingyang enlightened me: How many people in this world and how many such things they do every day, and how many are eligible to become cases.
I said that this is actually a case, but the leadership cannot find it out.
She said that in that case, you just confess.
So I confessed: that night, we left the back mountain and headed towards the scene of the crime.
