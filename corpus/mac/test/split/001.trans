When I was 21, I was jumping in the queue in Yunnan.
Chen Qingyang was twenty-six years old and worked as a doctor where I jumped in.
I am on the 14th team under the mountain, and she is on the 15th team on the mountain.
One day she came down from the mountain and discussed with me that she was not a broken shoe.
At that time, I didn't know her much, I could only say that I knew a little bit.
What she wants to discuss is this Xiang:
Although everyone said she was a torn shoe, she thought she was not.
She has not stolen a man because of broken shoes.
Although her husband has been in prison for a year, she has never stolen Han.
He had never stolen Han before.
So she can't understand why people say she is a broken shoe.
If I want to comfort her, it is not difficult.
I can logically prove that she is not a broken shoe.
If Chen Qingyang is a broken shoe, that is, Chen Qingyang steals a man, at least someone has stolen it.
Nowadays, someone cannot be pointed out, so Chen Qingyang’s stealing from a man cannot be established.
But I would say that Chen Qingyang is a torn shoe, and there is no doubt about it.
Chen Qingyang asked me to prove that she was not a broken shoe. The reason was that I asked her for an injection.
This happened as follows:
When the farm is busy, the captain does not ask me to plow the fields, but instead asks me to plant rice seedlings so that my waist cannot always stand upright.
Anyone who knows me knows that I have an old wound on my waist and I am more than 1.9 meters tall.
After a month of staying in this way, my back pain was unbearable, and I couldn't sleep without being closed.
The needles in our team’s infirmary had peeled off the coating and all had barbs. They often hooked the flesh off my waist.
Later, my waist seemed to have been hit by a shotgun, and the scars did not fade for a long time.
In this situation, I remembered that Chen Qingyang, the team doctor of the 15th team, was a doctor who graduated from Beijing Medical University and could probably distinguish between needles and hook needles, so I went to see her.
After I came back from the illness, less than half an hour later, she rushed to my room and asked me to prove that she was not a broken shoe.
Chen Qingyang said that she did not despise broken shoes at all.
According to her observation, broken shoes are very kind, helpful, and least willing to disappoint.
So she still has a little admiration for broken shoes.
The problem is not whether the broken shoes are good, but that she is not broken shoes at all.
Just like a cat is not a dog.
If a cat is called a dog, it will also feel very uncomfortable.
Everyone now calls her "Shoes", which makes her feel utterly unwilling, and hardly even knows who she is.
When Chen Qingyang was in my thatched house, she wore a white coat with bare arms and legs, just like her attire in the infirmary on the mountain.
The difference is that the loose long hair is tied with a handkerchief, and there are a pair of slippers on the feet.
Seeing her, I began to wonder: Is she wearing something under her white coat or nothing.
This can show that Chen Qingyang is very beautiful, because she thinks it doesn't matter what she wears or not.
This is the self-confidence cultivated since childhood.
I told her that she was indeed a torn shoe.
Also cite some reasons:
The so-called broken shoes is an allegation. Everyone says that you are broken shoes and you are broken shoes. There is no reason to say.
Everyone says that if you stole the Han, you are stealing the Han. There is no reason for this.
As for why everyone said you are a broken shoe, it looks like this:
Everyone believes that if a married woman does not steal, she should have a dark complexion and drooping breasts.
And your face is not black and white, and your breasts are not drooping and towering, so you are broken shoes.
If you don't want to be a broken shoe, you have to darken your face and droop your breasts. In the future, others will not call you a broken shoe.
Of course, this is a disadvantage. If you don't want to suffer, you should steal someone.
In this way, you also consider yourself a torn shoe.
Others are not obliged to figure out whether you are stealing or not before deciding whether to call you a broken shoe.
You are obliged to prevent others from breaking your shoes.
When Chen Qingyang heard this, his face flushed and his anger was wide, and he almost slapped me in the face.
This woman is famous for slapping people, and many people have slapped her.
But she was suddenly discouraged, and said: Okay, let's break your shoes.
But it's not your business that it's not black.
She also said that if I think too much about these things, I might be slapped in the face.
Going back to twenty years ago, imagine the situation when Chen Qingyang and I discussed the problem of worn-out shoes.
At that time, my complexion was scorched, my lips were chapped, with shredded paper and tobacco on it, and my hair was messy brown. I was wearing a torn army uniform with many holes made of adhesive tape. I was sitting on a wooden board with my legs crossed. On the bed, it was a hooligan look.
You can imagine how itchy palms of Chen Qingyang's palms were when he heard such a man talk about her breasts drooping and not drooping.
She is a little nervous, because there are many strong men who seek her to see a doctor, but in fact they are not sick.
Those people are not actually going to see the doctor, but to see the broken shoes.
I am the only exception.
It seems that Zhu Bajie has built two rake on my back waist.
Regardless of whether the back pain is true or not, just those holes can be a reason to see a doctor.
These holes gave her hope that she might prove to me that she is not a broken shoe.
One person admits that she is not a broken shoe, which is very different from no one admits.
But I let her down.
This is what I think: If I want to prove that she is not a broken shoe, I can prove that she is not a broken shoe. It would be too easy.
In fact, I can't prove anything, except for things that don't need to be proved.
In the spring, the captain said that I blinded his bitch's left eye, making it always turn his head to look at people, as if he was dancing a ballet.
From then on he always gave me small shoes.
I want to prove my innocence, there are only three ways:
1. There is no bitch in the captain's house;
2. The bitch is born without a left eye;
3. I am a handless person and cannot shoot with a gun.
The result is that none of the three rules holds true.
There is indeed a brown bitch in the captain's house. The bitch's left eye is indeed blinded the day after tomorrow. Not only can I shoot with a gun, but I can also shoot very well.
Not long before this, I also borrowed Luo Xiaosi's air gun, used a bowl of mung beans as bullets, and killed two catties of rats in the empty grain warehouse.
Of course, there are many people with good marksmanship in this team, including Luo Xiaosi.
The air gun was his, and I was watching when he beat the captain's bitch.
But I can't expose others, Luo Xiaosi and I are also good.
Besides, if the captain can provoke Luo Xiaosi, he won't recognize me.
So I remain silent.
Silence is the default.
So in the spring, I planted rice seedlings and lay them in the ground like a half-length telephone pole. After the autumn harvest, I went to herd cattle again and couldn't eat hot rice.
Of course, I would not do nothing.
One day on the mountain, I happened to borrow Luo Xiaosi's air gun. The bitch of the captain's house just ran up to the mountain and asked me to see it. I shot a bullet and blinded him in the right eye.
The dog has neither left eye nor right eye, so he can't run back to let the captain see it-God knows where it went.
I remember that in those days, I didn't seem to do anything except go up the mountain to herd cattle and lie down at home.
I think nothing has anything to do with me.
But Chen Qingyang ran down from the mountain to look for me.
It turned out that there was another rumor that she was breaking my shoes with me.
She asked me to prove our innocence.
I said that to prove our innocence, we can only prove the following two points:
1. Chen Qingyang is a virgin;
2. I am an eunuch and have no sexual intercourse ability.
Both of these points are difficult to prove.
So we cannot prove our innocence.
I tend to prove my innocence.
After hearing these words, Chen Qingyang first turned pale with anger, then flushed, and finally stood up without saying a word and left.
Chen Qingyang said, I have always been a villain.
The first time she asked me to prove her innocence, I rolled my eyes and started talking nonsense.
The second time she asked me to prove our innocence, I again solemnly suggested to her to hold a one-off handover.
So she decided to slap me sooner or later.
If I knew she had such a plan, maybe the next thing would not happen.
On my 21st birthday, I was grazing by the river.
In the afternoon I lay on the grass and fell asleep.
When I slept, I was covered with several plantain leaves, and when I woke up, I had nothing on my body (the leaves may have been eaten by the cow).
The sun in the subtropical dry season made me crimson and itchy, my little monk pointed straight to the sky, unprecedented in size.
This is the situation on my birthday.
When I woke up, the sun was dazzling and the sky was frighteningly blue, and a thin layer of dust fell on my body, like a layer of talcum powder.
The countless erections I have experienced in my life are not as strong and powerful as that one, probably because there is no one in the wild.
I got up to look at the cows and found that they were all lying in the distant river fort chewing grass quietly.
Wan Lai was silent at that time, and the white wind was blowing in the fields.
On the bank of the river, there were several pairs of bulls in the stockade fighting each other, their eyes were red and salivating.
The cow's scrotum is tight and the penis is straight.
Our cows don't do such things.
Despite the provocation by others, our cattle still lie still.
In order to prevent the fighting frame from hurting the body and affecting spring ploughing, we castrated them all.
I was there every time the steer.
For ordinary bulls, just cut them off with a knife.
But for those who are exceptionally instinct, hammer gelding is required, that is, cut open the scrotum, take out the testicles, and smash it with a wooden hammer.
From then on, the subject only knew how to eat grass and work, but didn't know anything else, and didn't even have to kill.
The captain of the hammer has no doubt that this kind of surgery can be equally effective when applied to humans. Every time he shouts to us: You lay eggs, you can only be honest with a hammer!
According to his logic, the red and red in my body is straightforward, and something about a foot long is the incarnation of sin.
Of course, I have different opinions on this.
In my opinion, this thing is extremely important, just like my existence itself.
The sky was slightly late, and there were lazy clouds floating in the sky.
The bottom half was sunk in the darkness, and the top half was still floating in the sun.
I was 21 years old that day. In the golden age of my life, I had a lot of extravagant hopes.
I want to love, I want to eat, and I want to become a half-dark cloud in the sky in an instant.
Later, I learned that life is a slow process of being hammered. People get older day by day, their extravagant hopes disappear day by day, and finally they become like a bull that has been hammered.
But I didn't foresee this when I celebrated my 21st birthday.
I think I will live forever, and nothing can hit me.
I invited Chen Qingyang to eat fish that night, so I should get the fish in the afternoon.
It wasn't until five o'clock in the afternoon that I wanted to go to the scene of the fish.
Before I walked into that Xiaohecha, two Jingpo children came out all the way from inside, and the mud flew all the way, and I suffered several pieces on my body. They didn't stop until I held their ears.
I asked, "Dick, where is the fish?"
That year's account is a bit bigger and said: "Ballenon is to blame!
He always sat on the dam and knocked the dam down! "
Lennon shouted straight, "Wang Er!
Dam hits the dick! "
I said, "Fart!
Laozi cut the turf and hit the dam, which cock dare not say anything? "
When I went inside, it didn’t matter whether it was because of Lennon’s sitting or because my dam hadn’t been built. Anyway, the dam was down, and the overflowing water flowed back. The fish was soaked in the soup, all day’s labor. It's all in vain.
Of course I couldn't admit that it was my fault, so I scolded Lenon.
Ledu (the other child) also fits me.
Lenon caught fire, jumped three feet high, and shouted, "Wang Er!
Ledu!
Cock!
Your brother-in-law partnered with me!
I will tell my dad to hit you with bronze guns! "
After speaking, the little boy rushed to the bank of the river, thinking about leaving.
I grabbed his ankle and pulled him off.
"Wow, we will drive you cows when you are gone?
Be your mother's sweet dream! "
This kid was screaming to bite me, and I split his hand and pressed it to the ground.
He foamed at the mouth and scolded me mixed with Chinese, Jingpo and Dai dialects. I used Zhengzhuangjing's film to scold me back.
Suddenly he stopped scolding, and looked at my lower body, with boundless envy on his face.
I looked down, and my little monk stood upright again.
Just listen to Lennon's compliment: "Wow!
Miss Riledu's sister! "
I quickly threw him down and put on pants.
In the evening when I light up the steam lamp in the pump room, Chen Qingyang will come suddenly, talking about her feeling very boring to be alive, and also said that she is innocent in everything.
I said she dared to feel that she was innocent, which in itself was the greatest sin.
In my opinion, everyone’s nature is lazy, lustful and lustful. If you are diligent and thrifty, and keep your body like jade, you are guilty of pretense, which is more abhorrent than lazy, lustful and lustful.
She seemed to hear these words very well, but never followed.
That night I lit the steam lamp by the river, but Chen Qingyang was too late. It was not until nine o'clock that she came to the door and called me: "Wang Er, bastard!
You come out! "
I went out and took a look. She was dressed in white and dressed exceptionally neatly, but her expression was not very relaxed.
She said: You invite me to eat fish and have a heartfelt conversation. Where is the fish?
I have to say that the fish is still in the river.
She said okay, there is still a heartfelt talk.
Just talk about it here.
I said to go into the room and talk, she said it was okay, so she went in and sat down, looking very angry.
On my 21st birthday, I intend to seduce Chen Qingyang in the evening because Chen Qingyang is my friend, and he has a full chest, a thin waist and a round butt.
Besides, her neck is straight and slender, and her face is very beautiful.
I want to have sex with her and think she shouldn't disagree.
If she wants to use my body to practice ripping, I must let her open.
So I can borrow her body for a use.
The only problem is that she is a woman, and a woman's family is always a little tricky.
For this, I wanted to inspire her, so I started to clarify what is meant by "yiqi".
In my opinion, loyalty is the kind of great friendship among heroes.
The heroes of the Water Margin, murder and arson are commonplace, but as soon as they heard of the name of Shih Yu, they immediately turned to worship.
I am also like those reckless heroes, who believe in nothing, the only thing that cannot be violated is loyalty.
As long as you are my friend, even if you are wicked and intolerable, I will stand by your side.
That night I dedicated my great friendship to Chen Qingyang. She was greatly moved and immediately said: She accepted this friendship.
Not only that, she also said that she would repay me with a greater friendship, even if I was a despicable villain and would not betray.
When I heard her say this, I felt relieved and said the following:
I am twenty-one years old and I have not experienced anything between men and women. I am really unwilling.
After she heard it, she started to froze, probably not mentally prepared.
She said nothing for a long time.
I put my hand on her shoulder and felt her muscles tense.
This girl may turn his face and slap me at any time. If so, it proves that women don't understand what friendship is.
But she didn't.
Suddenly she snorted and laughed.
Also said: I'm so stupid!
It's so easy to follow your way!
I said: What is it?
what did you say?
She said: I didn't say anything.
I asked her what I just said, would you agree to it?
She said Bah, and her face was flushed.
I think she was a little embarrassed, so she took the initiative and used her hands.
She gave me a few hands, and later said, not here, let's go to the mountain.
I went to the mountain with her.
Chen Qingyang later said that she never figured out whether my great friendship was real, or made up a temporary trick to lie to her.
But she also said that those words fascinated her like a spell, even if she lost everything for it, she was not insulted.
In fact, great friendship is neither true nor false, just like everything in the world, if you believe it is true, it will continue to be true.
If you suspect it is fake, it is fake.
My words are half true.
But I am ready to honor my words at any time, even if the sky is broken and the earth is torn apart.
Because of this attitude, no one believes me.
Although I regard making friends as a lifelong career, the only friends I make are Chen Qingyang and others.
We went to the mountain that night, and halfway she said she wanted to go home and asked me to wait for her on the back mountain.
I was a little suspicious that she was going to dry me, but I didn't say it, and went straight to the back mountain to smoke.
After waiting for some time, she came.
Chen Qingyang said that when I first went to her for an injection, she was dozing off at the desk.
Everyone in Yunnan has a lot of time to doze off, so they are always half asleep and half awake.
When I walked in, the room was dark, because it was an adobe house with a grass roof, and most of the light came in through the door.
She woke up at that moment and asked me what I was doing.
I said back pain, she said lie down and let me see.
I just fell over and fell on the bamboo bed, almost collapsing the bed.
My back pain is so bad that I can't bend at all.
If not, I would not come to her.
Chen Qingyang said that when I was very young, I was hungry and tattooed into my mouth, and my eyes were black.
I am tall, my clothes are ragged, and I don't like to talk.
She gave me an injection, and I left, as if she said thank you, but it didn't seem to say.
When she remembered that she could prove that she was not a broken shoe, half a minute had passed.
She chased it out and saw me taking a shortcut back to the 14th team.
I walked down the slope, jumped ditch at every ditch, jumped at every ridge, and descended fast down the mountain.
It was the morning of the dry season, and the wind was blowing from under the mountain, and I couldn't hear the call.
And I never look back.
I just left.
Chen Qingyang said that she wanted to chase me at the time, but found it difficult to catch up.
And I may not be able to prove that she is not a broken shoe.
So she went back to the infirmary.
Later, she changed her mind and went to me again because everyone said she was a broken shoe, so everyone was an enemy.
And I may not be the enemy.
She didn't want to miss the opportunity to make me an enemy.
I smoked on the back mountain that night.
Although at night, I can see far away.
Because the moonlight is very bright, the local air is very clean.
I can still hear the barking of dogs in the distance.
I saw Chen Qingyang as soon as he left the 15th team, and he might not be able to see so far during the day.
Even so, it is different from daytime.
Maybe it's because there is no one everywhere.
I can't say that there are no people on this mountain at night, because there are silver-gray patches everywhere.
If someone walks with a torch, that means I hope people all over the world will know where he is.
If you don't light a torch, it's like putting on a cloak. People who know you are there can see it, but people who don't know it can't.
When I saw Chen Qingyang approaching slowly, I was shocked, and thought without a teacher that I should have some affection before doing that.
Chen Qingyang's reaction to this was cold.
Her lips were cold and she didn't respond to caressing.
When I unbuttoned her hands and feet, she pushed me away, took off my clothes one by one, folded them and laid them aside, lying straight on the grass.
Chen Qingyang's nakedness is beautiful.
I quickly took off my clothes and crawled over, she pushed me away again, handed me something and said, "Will it be used?
Do you want me to teach you? "
That is a condom.
I'm in the mood, and I'm only slightly unhappy with her tone.
After putting it on, he climbed onto her again, messing around in a flustered manner, but didn't get it right.
Suddenly she said coldly and he said, "Hey!
Do you know what you are doing? "
I said of course I know.
Could you please lie down a bit?
I want to study your structure just as it is.
Just listening to a loud bang, like a thunder in the ear, she gave me a big slap in the face.
I jumped up, took my clothes, and walked away.
