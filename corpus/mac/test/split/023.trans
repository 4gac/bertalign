After Lei Zhicheng and Yang Weining were killed, their superiors quickly dealt with the matter as an ordinary work accident. In the eyes of everyone on the base, Ye Wenjie and Yang Weining were in a very good relationship, and no one suspected her.
The new political commissar of the base soon took office, and life was restored to the peace of the past. The little life in Ye Wenjie's belly grew up day by day. At the same time, she also felt the changes in the outside world.
On this day, the guard platoon leader called Ye Wenjie to the gate.
She walked into the guard box and was taken aback: There were three children, two men and one woman, fifteen or sixteen years old, all wearing old padded jackets and dog-skin caps, and they looked like locals.
The sentry told her that they belonged to Qijiatun. Hearing that there were all learned people on the radar peak, they wanted to ask a few questions about their studies.
Ye Wenjie thought to himself, how dare they go to Leida Peak?
This is an absolute military restricted zone, and the outpost only needs to warn anyone approaching without permission to fire.
The sentry saw Ye Wenjie’s doubts and told her that she had just received the order that the confidentiality level of the Red Bank Base had been lowered. As long as the locals did not enter the base, they could go up to the radar peak. Yesterday, several local farmers were here to send them. Dishes.
A child took out a shabby junior high school physics textbook. His hands were dark and cracked like bark. He asked a middle school physics question in a thick northeastern accent:
The textbook said that the free fall began to accelerate, but in the end it would always fall at a constant speed. They thought about it for several nights but couldn't understand it.
"You run so far just to ask this?" Ye Wenjie asked.
"Teacher Ye, don't you know?
The college entrance examination is out! "
The girl said cheerfully.
"The college entrance examination?"
"Just go to college!
Whoever learns well, whoever scores high in the exam can get it!
It was a year ago, don’t you know? ! "
"Not recommended?"
"No, anyone can take the test, even the'black five' children in the village can do it!"
Ye Wenjie was stunned for a long time, this change made her sigh.
After a while, she realized that the children holding the book in front of her were waiting, and quickly answered their questions, telling them that it was due to the balance of air resistance and gravity;
At the same time, he also promised that if you have learning difficulties in the future, you can come to her at any time.
Three days later, seven more children came to Ye Wenjie. Except for the three who had been there last time, the other four came from more distant villages and towns.
There were fifteen children who came to see her for the third time. There was also a teacher from the town middle school. Due to lack of people, he taught physics, mathematics and chemistry. He came to ask Ye Wenjie for some teaching problems.
This person was over half a hundred years old, his face was full of wind and frost, and he was in a mess in front of Ye Wenjie, and books fell to the ground.
After walking out of the sentry box, Ye Wenjie heard him say to the students: "Dolls, scientists, this is a serious scientist!"
From now on, children came to ask for advice every three days. Sometimes there were a lot of people who could not stand in the guard box. With the consent of the leader of the base’s security guard, the sentry took them to the dining room of the canteen, where Ye Wenjie set up a small blackboard to give it to him. Children lecture.
On New Year's Eve in 1978, Ye Wenjie's day after get off work was completely dark. Most of the people at the base had already gone down the mountain during the three-day holiday, and there was silence everywhere.
Ye Wenjie returned to her room, which used to be her and Yang Weining's home, but now it is empty, with only the child in her belly accompanying her.
In the cold night outside, the cold wind of Daxinganling was howling, and the sound of firecrackers from Qijiatun in the distance was faintly heard.
The loneliness pressed Ye Wenjie like a giant palm. She felt that she was getting smaller and smaller, and finally shrank to a small corner invisible to this world...
At this moment, there was a knock on the door. After opening the door, Ye Wenjie first saw the sentry. Behind him, there were a few Song Mingzi's flares swaying in the cold wind. The group of children holding the torches were red with cold and their dog-skin hats. There are icy ballasts on it, and there is a chill after entering the house.
There were two boys who had the most freezing cold. They dressed very thinly, but wrapped something in their arms with two thick cotton-padded clothes. They opened the cotton-padded clothes. It was a large porcelain basin with sauerkraut and pork dumplings. Braving.
That year, eight months after sending a signal to the sun, Ye Wenjie was in labor. Due to the incorrect fetal position, her body was very weak. The base health center did not have the conditions to deliver the baby, so she was sent to the nearest town hospital.
This was actually a ghost gate for Ye Wenjie. She encountered a dystocia and fell into a coma after severe pain and heavy bleeding. Only three hot and glaring suns slowly turned around her, cruelly scorching her.
After this scene lasted for a long time, she thought in her dimness that this might be her eternal destination. This is her hell. The fire of hell composed of three suns will burn her forever. This is because of her. Punishment for super betrayal.
She fell into intense fear, not for herself, but for the child-is the child still in her womb?
Or did she suffer eternal pain as she came to this hell?
I don't know how long it took, the three suns gradually receded, and after a certain distance, they suddenly shrank and turned into a crystal flying star. The surroundings became cooler and the pain was lessening. She finally woke up.
Ye Wenjie heard a cry in her ear, she turned her face laboriously, and saw the baby's pink, wet face.
The doctor told Ye Wenjie that she had more than 2,000 milliliters of bleeding. Dozens of farmers in Qijiatun came to donate blood to her. Many of them had children who she had counseled, but most of them were unfamiliar with their lives, just listening to their children and their parents. Speaking of her, if it weren't for them, she would be dead.
Later, it became a problem. Ye Wenjie was weak after giving birth, and it was impossible to bring her own children at the base, and she had no relatives and no reason.
At this time, a couple of elderly people in Qijiatun came to the base leader and said they could take Ye Wenjie and their children home to take care of them.
The man turned out to be a hunter, and he also picked some medicinal materials. Later, there were fewer and fewer forests around, so he planted the land, but people still called him headhunters.
They have two children and two daughters. The girls are married. One son is a soldier in the field, and the other has lived with them after getting married. The daughter-in-law has just given birth to a baby.
Ye Wenjie had not been rehabilitated at this time, and the leaders of the base were embarrassed, but there was only one way. They let them use a sled to pick Ye Wenjie home from the town hospital.
Ye Wenjie lived in this farmhouse in Daxinganling for more than half a year. She was weak after childbirth and had no milk. During this period, Yang Dong grew up eating hundreds of milk.
The one who feeds her the most is the headhunter's daughter-in-law, named Dafeng. This sturdy Dongbei Nizi eats sorghum rice slag and milks two babies at the same time. The milk is still prosperous.
The other breast-feeding wives in the village also came to feed Yang Dong. They liked her very much and said that this baby had the aura of her mother.
Gradually, Head Hunter Qi’s house became a gathering place for women in the village. The old and the young, the married and the eldest daughters, all loved to run here when they had nothing to do. They were full of envy and curiosity about Ye Wenjie, and she also found herself There are a lot of women to talk with them.
I can’t remember how many sunny days there are. Ye Wenjie hugged Yang Dong and the women in the village were sitting in a yard surrounded by birch pillars. Next to them were children playing and lazy big black dogs. The warm sun embraced all of this. .
Every time she paid special attention to those holding copper pipes and pots, the smoke from their mouths was soaked in sunlight, and they glowed with silvery soft light like the hairs on their plump skin.
Once one of them handed her a long cupronickel smoking pot to "relieve fatigue". She took only two puffs and was so dizzy that they made them laugh for several days.
Ye Wenjie didn't have much to say with the men. She didn't understand what they cared about every day. She wanted to plant some ginseng while the policy was loosened, but she didn't dare to do it.
They respect Ye Wenjie and are polite in front of her.
She didn't care about it at first, but when the days grew longer, when she saw how the men beat their wives rudely, how they flirted with the widows in the village, and said the words that made her blush at least. Feel the preciousness of this respect.
Every three to five, some of them always send the hare or pheasant they hit to the head hunter's home, and bring many strange and primitive toys that Yang Dong has made.
In Ye Wenjie's memory, these days did not seem to belong to her, as if they were fragments falling from other lives, flying into her own life like a feather.
This memory is condensed into a piece of European classical oil paintings. It is strange that it is not Chinese paintings or oil paintings. There are too many blanks in Chinese paintings, but life in Qijiatun has no blanks. Like classical oil paintings, it is full of richness. Open color.
Everything is strong and warm: the fire pit covered with thick grass, the Kanto and Moheyan in the copper smoke pot, the thick sorghum rice, the 65-degree sorghum wine...
But all this is passing in tranquility and peace, like a stream by the side of a village.
What made Ye Wenjie most memorable were those nights.
Head Hunter Qi's son went to the city to sell mushrooms. He was the first person to make money in the village. She lived with Dafeng.
At that time, Qijiatun hadn't been powered on. Every night, the two of them stood by an oil lamp, Ye Wenjie read a book, and Dafeng did needlework.
Ye Wenjie always unconsciously put the book and eyes close to the oil lamp, often the bangs were squeaked, and then they looked up and laughed at each other.
Dafeng had never happened before, her eyes were very good, and she was able to do fine work under the light of charcoal fire.
Two children less than half a year old were sleeping on the kang beside her. Their sleeping appearance was intoxicating. All that could be heard in the room was their even breathing.
Ye Wenjie was not used to sleeping on the kang bed at first, but always got angry. Later, she got used to it. In her sleep, she often felt that she had become a baby, lying in the warm embrace of a person. This feeling was so real that she cried after waking up several times. She was full of faces--but that person was not a father or mother, nor a dead husband, she didn't know who it was.
Once, when she put down her book, she saw Dafeng put the sole of her shoe on her lap, staring at Denghua blankly.
Seeing Ye Wenjie looking at herself, Dafeng suddenly asked: "Sister, do you think the stars in the sky won't fall?"
Ye Wenjie took a close look at Dafeng. You Deng was an excellent painter. He created this classic oil painting with dignified tones and bright colors:
Dafeng was wearing a cotton jacket, with a red bellyband and a round arm exposed. The oil lamp highlighted her image, painted the most eye-catching color on her most beautiful part, and concealed the rest in the dark brilliantly.
The background is also hidden, everything is submerged in a soft darkness, but you can still see a dark red halo on closer inspection. This halo is not from the oil lamp, but from the charcoal on the ground. You can see, The severe cold outside has begun to carve beautiful ice patterns on the windows with the warm humidity in the house.
"Are you afraid of the stars falling?"
Ye Wenjie asked gently.
Dafeng smiled and shook his head, "What are you afraid of?
They are so small. "
Ye Wenjie finally did not make an answer from an astrophysicist, she just said: "They are all very far away, and they can't fall down."
Dafeng was already satisfied with this answer, and started sewing again.
But Ye Wenjie's mind was ups and downs. She put down her book, lay on the warm Kang surface, closed her eyes slightly, and concealed the entire universe around the cabin in her imagination, just like an oil lamp concealed most of the cabin in the dark. .
Then, she replaced the universe in Dafeng's heart.
At this time, the night sky is a huge black sphere, the size of which is just right to buckle the world. The sphere is inlaid with countless stars and glows with crystal clear silver light. Each is no bigger than the round mirror on the old wooden table next to the bed. .
The world is flat, extending far and wide in all directions, but it always has sides.
This large plane is covered with mountains like Daxing'anling and forests. The forests are dotted with villages like Qijiatun...
This toy box-like universe made her feel extremely comfortable, and gradually the universe changed from imagination to dreamland.
In this small mountain village deep in the Greater Khingan Mountains, something in Ye Wenjie's heart gradually melted, and a small clear lake melted on the ice sheet of her mind.
After Yang Dong was born, he spent more than two years at the Hong'an base in tension and calm.
At this time, Ye Wenjie received a notice that both her and her father's cases were completely rehabilitated;
Soon after, I received a letter from her alma mater, saying that she could go back to work immediately.
A large amount of remittance came with the letter, which was the salary paid by the father after the policy was implemented.
At the base meeting, the leader finally called her Comrade Ye Wenjie.
Ye Wenjie faced all this calmly, without excitement or excitement.
She is not interested in the outside world and would rather stay in the secluded Hong'an base all the time, but for the sake of her children's education, she left the Hong'an base, which she thought was going to spend her life, and returned to her alma mater.
Walking out of the mountains, Ye Wenjie was full of the feeling of spring. The severe winter of the "Cultural Revolution" was indeed over and everything was recovering.
Although the catastrophe has just ended, and there is a ruin in sight, countless people are silently licking their wounds, but in people's eyes, the dawn of a new life in the future has already appeared.
Students with children appeared in universities, literary masterpieces in bookstores were sold out, technological innovation in factories became the most remarkable thing, and scientific research was covered with a sacred halo.
Science and technology became the only key to the future. People approach science sincerely like elementary school students. Although their struggles are naive, they are also down to earth.
At the first National Science Conference, Guo Moruo announced that the spring of science had arrived.
Is this the end of madness?
Science and reason are returning?
Ye Wenjie asked herself more than once.
Ye Wenjie never received news from the Three-body World until he left the Red Bank base.
She knew that it would take at least eight years to receive a reply from the world to her message, not to mention that after she left the base, she no longer had the conditions to receive replies from aliens.
That fact was too important, but she did it quietly by herself, which created an unreal feeling.
As time passed, this sense of illusion became stronger and stronger, and that event became more and more like one's own illusion, like a dream.
Can the sun really amplify radio waves?
Did she really use the sun as an antenna to transmit information about human civilization into the universe?
Have you really received a message from an alien civilization?
The bloody morning when she betrayed the entire human civilization really existed?
There was another murder...
Ye Wenjie tried to numb herself at work in order to forget the past-she almost succeeded, a strange self-protection instinct makes her no longer remember the past, no longer think of the connection she had with alien civilizations, life just This passed day by day in peace.
After returning to his alma mater for a while, Ye Wenjie took Dongdong to his mother Shaolin.
After the tragic death of her husband, Shaolin quickly recovered from her insanity and continued to survive the political cracks.
She kept up with the situation and chanted slogans, and finally got a little reward, and went back to the podium in the subsequent "resumption of classes and revolution".
But at this time, Shaolin did an unexpected thing, marrying a persecuted high-ranking cadre of the Ministry of Education, who was still living in the "cow shed" at the cadre's school.
Shaolin has her own thoughts about this. She knows in her heart that the chaos in society cannot last forever. The young rebels who seize power at present have no experience in managing the country. Sooner or later, the old cadres who are standing aside and being persecuted will still come to power. Ruling.
Later facts proved that her gambling was correct. The "Cultural Revolution" was not over yet, and her husband had partially restored his position. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he was quickly promoted to the deputy ministerial level.
With this background, Shaolin quickly rose to the top when the intellectual was regained courtesy.
After becoming a member of the Faculty of the Academy of Sciences, she was wisely transferred from the original school and soon promoted to the vice president of another prestigious university.
The mother Ye Wenjie saw was a well-maintained intellectual woman, with no trace of past suffering.
She warmly received Ye Wenjie’s mother and daughter, and asked her with concern how she came over these years, marveling at how smart and cute Dongdong is, and meticulously explained to the cooking nanny Ye Wenjie’s favorite dishes...
All this is done so decently, so skillfully, so just right.
But Ye Wenjie clearly felt the estrangement between them. They carefully avoided sensitive topics and did not talk about Ye Wenjie's father.
After dinner, Shaolin and her husband sent Ye Wenjie and the child a long way away. The deputy minister said that she wanted to have a word with Ye Wenjie, and Shaolin went back first.
At this moment, the Vice Minister's face changed from a warm smile to frosty, as if he pulled off a mask impatiently. He said:
"You are welcome to bring your children often in the future, but there is one thing, do not come to pursue old historical accounts.
Your mother is not responsible for your father's death, she is also a victim.
It's your father who has become a bit perverted with his own beliefs. He walked all the way to the dark and abandoned his responsibilities to the family. Your mother and daughter have suffered so much. "
"You are not qualified to talk about my father," Ye Wenjie said angrily. "This is a matter between my mother and me, and has nothing to do with anyone else."
"It really has nothing to do with me," Shaolin's husband nodded coldly, "I am conveying your mother's meaning."
Ye Wenjie looked back, and Shao Lin opened a corner of the curtain to peep in the upper room with a courtyard.
Ye Wenjie silently picked up Dongdong and left, and never went back again.
Ye Wenjie inspected the four Red Guards who killed his father in many ways, and found three of them.
All three of them are sent back to the city, and now they have no jobs.
After learning their addresses, Ye Wenjie wrote a simple letter to them and asked them to talk to the playground where their father was killed.
Ye Wenjie has no plans for revenge.
On the morning of the rising sun at the Red Bank Base, she had already avenged all mankind, including them. She only wanted to hear the confession of these murderers, and see even a little bit of human return.
After class this afternoon, Ye Wenjie waited for them on the playground.
She didn't have much hope, almost certain that they would not come, but at the appointed time, three old Red Guards came.
Ye Wenjie recognized the three people from a distance, because they were all wearing green uniforms that are now rare.
After approaching, she found that this was probably the clothes they wore at the critical meeting. The clothes were washed white and had obvious patches.
But other than that, these three women in their thirties had no resemblance to the three heroic Red Guards. What disappeared from them, apart from youth, obviously had more.
Ye Wenjie's first impression is that compared with the uniformity of the year, the difference between them has become greater.
One of them became very thin, and the clothes she wore back then were a little too big. Her back was a little bent and her hair turned yellow, showing a trace of oldness;
The other became very sturdy, her clothes could not be buttoned on her awkward body, her hair was disheveled, her face was dark, and she had obviously been worn away by the hard life of all women’s exquisiteness. Rude and numb;
The third woman still had some shadows of her youth, but one of her sleeves was empty, and she wandered about when she walked.
The three old Red Guards walked up to Ye Wenjie and stood in a row facing her—they faced Ye Zhetai back then—trying to reproduce the long-forgotten dignity, but their devilish spirit back then The power is obviously gone.
There is a mouse expression on the thin woman's face, the stout woman's face is numb, and the one-armed woman's eyes are looking at the sky.
"Do you think we dare not come?"
The stout woman asked defiantly.
"I think we should meet each other, the past events should always be over." Ye Wenjie said.
"It's over, you should have heard of it."
The thin woman said, her voice was high-pitched, as if she was always panicked from nowhere.
"I mean mentally."
"Then you are ready to listen to our confession?" the stout woman asked.
"Should you not confess?"
"Then who confessed to us?" said the one-armed woman who had been silent.
The stout woman said: "Of the four of us, three of us signed the big-character poster of the Tsinghua High School Affiliated High School. From the big series, the big review to the big fight, from the'first division','second division', and'three divisions'. From "Linkage", "Western Correction", "East Correction", to "New Beida Commune", "Red Flag Fighting Team" and "Dongfanghong", we have experienced the whole process of the Red Guards from life to death."
The one-armed woman went on to say: "In the hundred days of fighting on the Tsinghua campus, four of us, two were in'Jinggangshan', and two were in'April 14'.
I once rushed to the earth-built tank in ‘Jinggang Mountain’ with a hand grenade. This hand was crushed by the wheels of the tank. At that time, the flesh and bones were on the ground and turned into mud-I was only fifteen years old that year. "
"Later we went to a vast world!"
The stout woman raised her hands and said, "Four of us, two went to Shaanxi, and two to Henan, which are the most remote and poorest places.
When I first went, I was still very energetic, but after a long day, after a day of farm work, I was too tired to wash my clothes;
Lying in the leaky thatched cottage, listening to the wolf cry in the distance, slowly returning from dream to reality.
When we stay in a remote country, it's really a matter of silence every day. "
The one-armed woman looked at the ground blankly and said: "Sometimes, on the path of a barren mountain, I meet a former Red Guard comrade or an enemy in a fight. Both sides look at each other. The same clothes are ragged, the same dust and cow dung. , Looking at each other speechlessly."
"Tang Hongjing," the stout woman said, staring at Ye Wenjie, "it was the girl who drew the most deadly belt at your father's head and drowned in the Yellow River.
The flood swept away a few sheep in the team, and the team secretary shouted at the educated youth: Revolutionary teenagers, it's time to test you!
So Hong Jing and three other educated youths jumped into the river to fish for sheep. It was still freezing flood at the time, and there was still a layer of ice floating on the water!
All four of them died, but they were drowned or frozen.
When I saw their bodies...
I... I can't fucking go on..."
She covered her face and started crying.
The thin woman sighed with tears, "I went back to the city later, but what about coming back?
Still nothing. The educated youth who came back have a hard time, and people like us can't find the last job. Without a job, no money, no future, nothing. "
Ye Wenjie was completely speechless.
The one-armed woman said: "There is a movie called "Maple" recently. Have you seen it?
At the end, an adult and a child were standing in front of the tomb of the Red Guards who had died in armed fighting. The child asked the adult: Are they martyrs?
Adults say no
The child asked again: Are they enemies?
The adults said it was not;
The child asks again: What are they?
The adults said: It's history. "
"Did you hear that?
It's history!
It's history! "
The stout woman excitedly waved a big hand to Ye Wenjie and said,
"Now is the new era, who will remember us and take us seriously?
Everyone will forget it soon! "
The three old Red Guards left, leaving Ye Wenjie alone on the playground. On that rainy and rainy afternoon more than ten years ago, she stood here alone, looking at her dead father.
The last words of the old Red Guard kept echoing in her mind...
The setting sun cast a long shadow on Ye Wenjie's thin body.
In her mind, the little hope that had just appeared in society evaporated like dew under the scorching sun, and the suspicion of the super betrayal she had made disappeared without a trace, introducing a higher civilization in the universe. The human world has finally become Ye Wenjie's unwavering ideal.
