Later, I saw Chen Qingyang again, registered a room with her in the hotel, and then went to the room together, I reached out and helped her take off her coat.
Chen Qingyang said that Wang Er has become civilized.
This shows that I have changed a lot.
In the past, I not only looked fierce, but also acted fiercely.
Chen Qingyang and I did another case in the hotel.
The heating there is very warm, and there is also brown glass.
I sat on the sofa, she sat on the bed and chatted for a while, and gradually got a criminal atmosphere.
I said, donâ€™t you let me see how drooping, let me see.
She stood up, took off her coat, wearing a big flowered shirt.
Then she sat down again and said, it's a little bit earlier.
The waiter will bring boiling water in a while.
They had the keys and they came in without knocking the door.
I asked her, what did someone say when I ran into it?
She said that she had never been run into.
But I heard that people would slam the door and said outside: What a fucking annoying!
Before I escaped into the mountain with Chen Qingyang, I was cooking pig food on a pig farm once.
At that time, I had to burn the fire, chop the pork chop (the so-called pork chop is sweet potato vines, water hyacinth, etc.), and add chaff and water to the pot.
I am doing several things at the same time.
However, the military representative was on the sidelines, talking about how bad I was.
He also asked me to tell my "stinky bitch" Chen Qingyang how bad she is.
Suddenly, I got angry, and I picked up the long spoon and cut it according to the pumpkin seeds hanging on the beam, and cut it in half.
The military representative jumped out of the room in shock.
If he continues to scold me, I will chop his head.
I am so vicious because I don't speak.
Later, in the People's Insurance Group, I didn't talk a lot, including when people tied me up.
So my hands are often tied to black.
Chen Qingyang often speaks.
She said: Sister-in-law, the tie hurts.
Or: Sister-in-law, give me a pad of handkerchief.
I have a handkerchief tied to my hair.
She cooperated with people everywhere, and suffered less.
We are different everywhere.
Chen Qingyang said, I was not civilized before.
In the People's Insurance Group, they let us loose.
The rope left many marks on her shirt.
This is because the rope is usually placed in the shed where the fire is burning, and it is stained with pot ashes and firewood.
She brushed away the marks with her inflexible hands, only the front, not the back.
When she wanted to call me to dust, I stepped out.
By the time she chased out the door, I had already walked a long way, I walked very fast, and never looked back.
For these reasons, she doesn't love me at all, nor can she like it.
According to the leadership's nature, what we did on the back mountain was not a case except for the time when she was like a koala.
Things like what we did when we opened up wasteland can only be regarded as minor problems.
So I did not continue to explain.
In fact, there is something else.
At that time, the hot wind was strong, and Chen Qingyang slept soundly with his headrest and arms.
I completely untied her skirt.
In this way she exposed her upper body, as if on purpose.
The sky was blue and bright, so that the shadows were full of blue light.
Suddenly, my heart moved, and I leaned over her red body.
I forgot what I did.
I told this story, thinking Chen Qingyang must not remember.
But she said, "Remember to remember!
I woke up at that moment.
Did you give me a kiss on my belly button?
It's dangerous, I almost fell in love with you. "
Chen Qingyang said that when she just woke up, she saw my unkempt head on her belly, and then she touched her belly button gently.
She couldn't hold herself at that moment.
But she still pretended to be asleep, to see what I wanted to do.
But I didn't do anything, raised my head and looked around, then walked away.
The confession material I wrote said that we left the back mountain that night and set off to the scene of the crime. We carried a lot of altars and pots on our backs. The plan was to settle in the mountains to the south.
The land over there is fertile, and there is a deep grass on both sides of the road.
Unlike the back mountain of the 15th team, the grass is only half a foot tall.
There was the moon that night, and we walked a section of the highway, so by the time it was about to get foggy, we had already walked 20 kilometers and went up the mountain to the south.
Specifically, when you reach the grassland south of Zhangfeng Village, you will find the forest.
We camped under a big green tree, picked up two pieces of dried cow dung to make a fire, and spread a plastic sheet on the ground.
Then he took off all his clothes (the clothes were already wet), hugged them together, wrapped three blankets, rolled them into a ball, and fell asleep.
Was frozen up after an hour of sleep.
The triple blankets were soaked, and the cow dung fire went out.
The water droplets on the tree fell like a downpour.
The water floating in the air is the size of a mung bean.
Those were the coldest days of the dry season in January.
The shadow of the mountain is so damp.
Chen Qingyang said that when she woke up, she heard me shooting a machine gun in her ear.
The upper tooth touches the lower tooth more than one second.
And I already have heat.
When I catch a cold, it is not easy to get better, and I must get an injection.
She got up and said, no, so both people will be sick.
Do that quickly.
I refused to move and said: Be patient.
The sun will be out in a while.
Then he said: Do you think I can do it?
This was the situation before the incident.
The situation at the time of the case was this:
Chen Qingyang rode on me and fell together, and the sky behind her was a vast cloud of mist.
It didn't seem to be so cold at this time, and there were cow bells all around.
The old Dai in this place didn't shut the cows, and the buffalo ran out by themselves at dawn.
The cows had wooden bell crotches tied to their bodies and made a muffled noise when they walked.
A behemoth suddenly appeared beside us, with drops of water hanging on the bristles around the ears.
It was a white buffalo, it turned its head and looked at us with one eye.
The horns of the white buffalo can be used as a knife handle, which is crystal clear and beautiful.
But it is brittle and easy to crack.
I have a dagger, which is also a white horn handle, but it doesn't split at all. It's rare.
The material of the blade was good, but it was taken away by the PICC.
Later, it was all right, and I asked them for it, but said that I couldn't find it.
And my shotgun, he refused to return me.
Lao Guo of the People's Insurance Group begged to buy it, but he only offered fifty yuan.
In the end, even the gun and the knife, I didn't want to come back.
Chen Qingyang and I chatted for a long time before committing crimes in the hotel.
Finally, she took off her shirt and wore a skirt and leather boots.
I walked over and sat next to her and lifted her hair.
Her hair is quite white.
Chen Qingyang scalded his head.
She said that her hair was good before, and she couldn't bear to perm it.
It's okay now.
She is now the deputy dean. She is very busy and cannot wash her hair every day.
In addition, there are many wrinkles at the corners of the eyes and under the neck.
She said that her daughter suggested she go for cosmetic surgery.
But she didn't have time to do it.
Later she said, okay, just watch.
Just go to untie the bra.
I wanted to help her, but I didn't help.
Buckle it in front, I stretched my hand to the back.
She said that it seemed you didn't learn badly, so she turned around to show me.
I watched it carefully for a while and made a few comments.
For some reason, she blushed a little and said, okay, I've seen it.
What else to do?
Just put on the bra.
I said, don't be busy, just leave it like that.
She said, why, still study my structure?
I said, of course.
Don't worry now, let's talk for a while.
She blushed even more, and said: Wang Er, you will never learn well, you will always be an asshole.
I was in the People's Insurance Group, Luo Xiaosi came to see me, and when he leaned on the window, I was tied up like a zongzi.
He thought that the case was serious and I would be shot, threw a box of cigarettes in from the window, and said: Second brother, buddy, it's a bit interesting.
Then cried.
Luo Xiaosi is full of emotions and cry easily.
I asked him to light a cigarette and pass it in through the window, and he did so, almost dislocated his shoulder before passing it to my mouth.
Then he asked me what else to do, and I said no.
I also said, don't hire a large group of people to visit me.
He also complied.
After he left, another group of children climbed up the window sill to look. They saw me being smoky with one eye opened and closed, looking very ugly.
The one at the beginning couldn't help but say: playing hooliganism.
I said, your father and your mother are only playing hooligans. Can they have you if they are not hooligans?
The kid caught some mud and threw it at me.
When I let go, I went to his dad and said: Today I was in the PICC and was tied up like a pig.
Ling Lang's Xiao Zhida, while throwing mud at me.
When the man heard it, he grabbed his son and beat him.
I left after watching.
When Chen Qingyang heard about this, he had this comment: Wang Er, you are a bastard.
Actually I am not always a bastard.
I now have a family and a mouth, and I have learned a lot.
After smoking the cigarette, I hugged her and caressed her on her chest skillfully, and then I wanted to take off her skirt.
She said: Don't be busy, talk a little longer.
You give me a cigarette too.
I lighted a cigarette and gave it to her.
Chen Qingyang said that she rode up and down on me in Zhangfeng Mountain, her eyes widened, covered in gray mist.
Suddenly I felt very lonely, very lonely.
Although part of me rubbed in her body, she was still very lonely, very lonely.
Later I came back alive and said: Change, look at me, and I will turn to it.
She said, that time you were a bastard than any other time.
Chen Qingyang said, that time I was a jerk than any other time, because I suddenly discovered that her feet were small and beautiful.
So I said, Lao Chen, I am going to be a foot worshiper.
Then I held her legs up and kissed the soles of her feet.
Chen Qingyang lay flat on the grass, holding the grass with his hands spread out.
Suddenly she shook her head, covered her face with her hair, and then snorted.
I wrote in the confession material that I let go of her legs and stroked the hair on her face.
Chen Qingyang struggled violently and shed tears, but did not move.
There were two unhealthy blushes on her face.
Then she stopped struggling and said to me, bastard, what do you want to do with me.
I said, what's wrong.
She laughed again and said: Not so.
Come on.
So I held her legs up again.
She just lay still, her hands flat, her teeth biting her lower lip, and there was no sound.
If I look at her more, she will smile.
I remember her face was very white and her hair was very black, and that was the whole situation.
Chen Qingyang said that when she was lying in the cold rain that time, she suddenly felt that every pore had entered the cold rain.
She felt sorrow from it and couldn't stop it.
Suddenly, a huge pleasure burst in.
The cold mist and rain all permeated her body.
She wanted to die at that time.
She couldn't bear it and wanted to call out, but she didn't want to call out when she saw me.
There is no man in the world who can tell her to call out in front of him.
She is incompatible with anyone.
Chen Qingyang told me later that every time he had sex with me, he was tortured.
Deep down she wanted to scream out and hug me and kiss her wildly, but she was not happy.
She does not want to love others, no one loves;
Nevertheless, when I kissed her feet, a pungent sensation still penetrated into her heart.
Chen Qingyang and I were having sex on Zhangfeng Mountain, and there was an old buffalo watching.
Then it ran away with a moo, leaving only the two of us.
After a long time, the sky gradually brightened.
The fog dissipated from the zenith.
Chen Qingyang's body was stained with dew and gleamed.
I let her go, stood up, saw that she was very close to the stockade, and said: go.
So I left that place and never went back.
I said in my presentation that Chen Qingyang and I committed countless crimes on the mountain behind Daddy Liu.
This is because Daddy Liu's land is cooked land, which is not so laborious to open.
Life is also stable, so food and clothing produce lust.
There was no one on that mountain, and Dad Liu was lying on the bed dying.
The mountains are either fog or rain. Chen Qingyang has my strap around his waist and a knife hung on it.
Wear tall rain boots, nothing else.
Chen Qingyang later said that she had only made one friend of me in her life.
She said that all of this was because I talked about great friendship in the cabin by the river.
People have to do several things in life, and this is one of them.
She never had friendship with anyone since.
Doing the same thing too much is boring.
I had a hunch about this.
So when I asked her about this, I said, "Man, how about our great friendship?"
We are incompetent, so we had no choice but to make friendship.
She said yes.
How to Dun?
Don't go on the opposite side?
I said the opposite of Tun.
It was on the ground at that time.
Because it was against Dun, she spread the two pieces of clothing on the ground. She lay on it, like a horse, and said: You better hurry up, Daddy Liu should get the injection.
I wrote these things into the confession materials, and the leadership asked me to confess:
1. Who is "Guo Lun";
2. What is "Guo Guo" great friendship;
3. What is going forward Guo and what is going backward Guo.
After I explained all of these things, the leaders told me to drop more posts in the future, and confess what was the problem.
When the Great Friendship was on the mountain, white gas was sprayed from his mouth.
It's not so cold, but it's very wet, and I can wring out water after a handful.
Right next to the clothes, the earthworm was crawling.
That piece of land is really fat.
Later, the corn was not fully cooked, so we put it in a mortar and pounded it. This is what the old Jingpo had done on the mountain.
The corn cake made is not bad.
It is not bad for many days if left in cold water.
Chen Qingyang was lying in the cold rain, his breasts felt like cold apples.
The skin of her whole body was taut, as if tossed marble.
Later, I pulled out the little monk and shot the semen into the ground.
She was watching, with a panic on her face.
I told her: This will make you fatter.
She said: I know.
Later, he said: Will Xiao Wanger grow out of the groundâ€”is this like what a doctor said?
After the rainy season passed, we disguised as old Dai and went to Qingping to drive the streets.
I have already written about the later things. I met my classmates in Qingping.
Despite the disguise, people still recognize me at a glance.
I am too tall to pretend to be short.
People said to me: Second brother, where did you go?
I said: I can't speak Chinese!
Although I tried my best to add a bit of eccentricity, it was still a Beijing movie.
One sentence reveals the stuff.
It was her idea to go back to the farm.
Since I went up the mountain myself, I didn't plan to go down.
She and I went up the mountain for a great friendship.
I can't help but accompany her down.
In fact, we can escape at any time, but she is not happy.
She said that life now is very interesting.
Chen Qingyang later said that she also found it interesting in the mountains.
When the mountains were cold and foggy, he wore a knife on his waist and walked into the rain with high boots.
But the same thing is no longer interesting if you do too much.
So she still wants to go down the mountain and endure the destruction of the world.
Chen Qingyang and I relived the great friendship in the hotel. When we talked about coming down from the mountain, we walked to a fork in the road.
There are four fork roads in that place, each leading to one side.
It doesn't matter if there is east, west, south or north. One goes to foreign countries, which is unknown; one goes to the inland; one goes to the farm; the other is our way.
That road also leads to Husa.
There are many Ajia blacksmiths, who have been blacksmiths for generations.
Although I am not for generations, I can also be a blacksmith.
I know those people very well, and they all admire my skills.
The Aya women are very beautiful, with many copper hoops and silver coins hanging on their bodies.
Chen Qingyang was very fascinated by that kind of dress, and she wanted to be a troop on the mountain.
Just after the rainy season, clouds rose from all directions.
A ray of sunlight flashed on the sky.
We have various choices and can go in all directions.
So I stood on the intersection for a long time.
Later, when I returned to the mainland, I stood on the highway and waited for the car. I had two options. I could wait for a while or I could go back to the farm.
When I walk down one road, I always think about the other road in my heart.
At this time, I feel confused.
Chen Qingyang said that I have medium aptitude, very clever hands, and very mixed people.
This is all indicative.
I don't agree with saying that I have medium talent.
Said that I am particularly confused, the facts are there and cannot be denied.
As for my dexterity, I may have experienced it myself.
My hands are indeed very clever, not only in touching women.
The palm is small and the fingers are very long, so you can do any delicate work.
Those Ajia blacksmiths on the mountain are better than me, but it is better than carving patterns on a knife. No one can compare.
So at least twenty blacksmiths have proposed that we move over, he will cut the pattern, and we will join the team.
If you had moved there, you might not even be able to speak Chinese now.
If I move to live with a big brother A Yan, I am now allowed to cut patterns with a knife in the blacksmith's shop.
In his muddy backyard, there must be a large litter of cubs. There are four combinations:
1. Chen Qingyang and mine;
2. The brother and sister-in-law of Aya;
3. My sister-in-law and I;
4. Chen Qingyang and Ah Yan's brother.
Chen Qingyang came back from the mountain with firewood, lifted up his clothes, revealing extremely strong breasts, and indiscriminately fed one of them.
If I retreated back to the mountain, something like this would happen.
Chen Qingyang said that such a thing would not happen because it did not happen. What actually happened was that we went back to the farm and wrote confession materials for a business trip.
Although he could run away at any time, he did not run.
This is what really happened.
Chen Qingyang said that my talent is normal, and she obviously didn't take my literary talent into consideration.
Everyone loves to read the explanatory materials I wrote.
When I first started writing those things, I had a lot of resistance.
Just write and get fascinated.
This is obviously because what I wrote is all about what happened.
What has happened has incredible charm.
I wrote down all the details in the presentation materials, but did not write the following things that have happened:
Chen Qingyang and I were on the back mountain of the 15th team. After drying in the thatched cottage, we went to the mountain stream to play in the water.
The water coming down from the mountain stripped the red clay, exposing the blue clay below.
We climbed onto the blue clay to bask in the sun.
After warming up, the little monk stood up again.
But I just vented, not like an anxious pervert.
So I lay on my side behind her, pillowing her hair into her body.
We were in the hotel and later relived the great friendship in this way.
Chen Qingyang and I lay on the blue clay side by side. It was getting late and the wind was a bit cold.
Lie calmly together, sometimes moving slightly.
It is said that there are reproductive and entertaining ways between dolphins. This means that dolphins also have great friendship.
Chen Qingyang and I are connected together like two dolphins.
Chen Qingyang and I were on the blue clay and closed our eyes, as if two dolphins were swimming in the sea.
When it got dark, the sun gradually turned red.
There was a cloud in the sky, pale and pale, turning the belly of countless dead fish, staring at countless dead fish's eyes.
There was a wind on the mountain, blowing down silently.
The world is full of miserable atmosphere.
Chen Qingyang shed a lot of tears.
She said that she was hurt by the scene.
I also saved a copy of the materials I gave back in the past, and once showed it to a friend who was engaged in English and American literature. He said it was very good, with the charm of Victorian underground novels.
As for the deleted details, he also said that they were deleted well. Those details undermined the integrity of the story.
My friend really asked the university.
I was very young when I wrote the materials, and I had no knowledge (and I have no knowledge yet), and I donâ€™t know what underground novels in the Victorian period are.
What I think is that I cannot teach others.
A lot of people want to read my explanation. If they can't help but break their shoes, it won't hurt you. If they learn this, it won't be great.
I also missed the following facts in my presentation materials for the reasons mentioned above.
We made a mistake and should have been shot. The leadership saved us and asked me to write down the materials. What a forgiveness!
So I made up my mind to just write how bad we are.
When the two of us were on the mountain behind Daddy Liu, Chen Qingyang made a skirt for himself, and wanted to wear it to disguise as an old Dai, and go to Qingping to drive the streets.
But she couldn't even walk after putting it on.
When I walked to the south of Qingping, I encountered a river. The water coming down from the mountain was as cold as ice and as green as salted snow.
The water was waist-deep and very urgent.
I walked over, carried her on one shoulder, and walked straight across the river before letting it down.
One of my shoulders was exactly as wide as Chen Qingyang's waist, and I remember her blush was so bad at that time.
I also said that I can carry you to Qingping, and then carry it back, faster than you squeaky walk.
She said, go to your mother.
The tube skirt is like a cloth tube, and the bottom mouth is only one foot wide.
People who know how to wear can do all kinds of things inside, including peeing on the street without squatting down.
Chen Qingyang said that she would never learn this skill.
After observing for a while on the Qingping Episode, she came to the conclusion that if you want to pretend to be A Yan.
The way back was up the mountain, and her strength was exhausted.
Every time she crosses the ditch and ridges, she finds a tree stump, stands up with grace, and lets me carry her.
Carry her uphill on the way back.
When the dry season just arrived, the sky was full of white clouds and the sun was shining.
But there is still light rain in the mountains.
The big plates of red clay are slippery.
I walked on that mudboard, like my first time on the ice rink.
At that time, I clasped her thigh with my right hand, with a shotgun in my left hand, and a basket on my back. Walking on the slippery slope was very difficult.
Suddenly I slid to the left, and I was about to slide into the ravine. Fortunately, I had a gun in my hand and slammed it on the ground.
At that time, my whole body was tensed, I was struggling with my life, and finally supported me.
But this idiot came to add confusion, thrashing on my back, let me let her go.
Almost died that time.
When I was able to catch my breath, I took the gun to my right hand and slapped her ass with my left hand.
After a thin layer of cloth, it looks extra smooth.
Her ass is round.
Dick, it feels very good!
She was honest after those two blows.
Very obedient, without saying a word.
Of course, hitting Chen Qingyang's ass is not a good thing, but I don't think there is necessarily such a thing between other broken shoes and wild guys.
This matter digressed, so I didn't write it.
