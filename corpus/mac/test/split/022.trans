The meeting place for "Three Body" netizens is a small, secluded cafe.
In Wang Miao’s impression, the gatherings of game netizens in this era are crowded and lively events, but this time there are only seven people, including himself, and those six are the same as him, no matter how they look at them. Game lovers.
There are only two younger ones, and the other five, including one lady, are middle-aged, and there is an old man who looks sixty or seventy years old.
Wang Miao thought that everyone would have a lively discussion about "Three Body" as soon as they met, but now he found that he was wrong.
The weird and far-reaching connotation of "Three-Body" has had a profound psychological impact on its participants, making it difficult for everyone, including Wang Miao himself, to talk about it easily.
Everyone simply introduced themselves to each other. The old man took out a very delicate pipe, filled it with tobacco and smoked it, and walked to the wall to admire the painting on the wall.
The others were all sitting and waiting for the party organizer to arrive, they all arrived early.
In fact, two of these six people already know Wang Miao.
The old man with a childlike appearance is a famous scholar, famous for giving modern scientific connotations to Eastern philosophy.
The lady in weird dress is a famous writer, a rare novelist with avant-garde style but with many readers. You can read the book she wrote from any page.
The other four, two middle-aged people, one is the vice president of the country's largest software company (dressed casually, you can't see it at all), and the other is a senior leader of the State Power Company.
Two young people, one is a reporter from a major domestic media, and the other is a PhD student in science.
Wang Miao now realizes that a considerable part of the players of "Three-Body" may be social elites like them.
The organizer of the party came soon. Wang Miao saw him, and his heartbeat suddenly accelerated. This person was Pan Han, the number one suspect who killed Shen Yufei.
He quietly took out his phone and texted Da Shi under the table.
"Hehe, everyone came so early!"
Pan Han said hello easily, as if nothing happened.
He changed his usual dirty hobo appearance in the media, in suits and leather shoes, and looked personable. "You are almost the same as I imagined, all of which are elites. "Three Body" is for your class. Its connotation and artistic conception are difficult for ordinary people to understand;
The knowledge required to play it, its high level and deep content, is also impossible for ordinary people to possess. "
Wang Miao’s text message has been sent: I saw Pan Han at Yunhe Cafe in Xicheng District.
Pan Han went on to say: "Everyone here is an excellent player of "Three-Body", with the best results, and they are all very good players.
I believe that "Three Body" has become a part of your life. "
"It's a part of life." The young doctoral student said.
"I saw it by chance on my grandson's computer," the old philosopher said, tilting the pipe handle. "The young man gave up after playing it a few times. It was too esoteric.
I was attracted by it. The deep connotation, the weird and terrifying and beautiful artistic conception, the logically rigorous world setting, the huge amount of information and precise details hidden under the concise appearance all fascinated us. "
Several netizens, including Wang Miao, nodded repeatedly.
At this time, Wang Miao received a text message from Da Shi: We also saw him, it’s okay, what should I do.
Note that you have to act as extreme as possible in front of them, but don't go too far to pretend to be different.
"Yes," the female writer nodded in agreement.
"From a literary point of view, "Three Body" is also remarkable. The rise and fall of the two hundred and three rounds of civilization is really a beautiful epic."
She mentioned 203 rounds of civilization, while Wang Miao experienced 191 rounds, which convinced Wang once again that "Three-Body" has an independent process for each player.
"I'm really tired of the real world, "Three Body" has become my second reality." The young reporter said.
"is it?"
Pan Han interjected with interest.
"Me too, compared with "Three Body", the reality is so mediocre and vulgar." said the vice president of IT.
"It's a pity, it's just a game." The leader of Guodian said.
"Very good." Pan Han nodded, and Wang Miao noticed the excitement in his eyes.
"There is a question, I think we all want to know." Wang Miao said.
"I know what it is, but you can ask." Pan Han said.
"Is "Three-Body" just a game?"
Netizens nodded one after another, obviously this is what they are eager to ask.
Pan Han stood up and said solemnly: "The Three-Body World is real."
"Where?" Several netizens asked in unison.
Pan Han sat down and remained silent for a long time before speaking, "I can answer some questions, and some can't, but if you are connected to the Three-Body World, all your questions will be answered one day."
"So, does the game show some real elements of the three-body world?" the reporter asked.
"First of all, in many rounds of civilization, the dehydration function of the Trisolaran is real. In order to deal with the unpredictable natural environment, they can completely drain the water in their body at any time and turn it into a dry fibrous body to escape A harsh climate completely unsuitable for survival."
"What does the Trisolaran look like?"
Pan Han shook his head: "I don't know, I really don't know.
In each round of civilization, the appearance of the trisolaran is completely different. In addition, the game also reflects a real existence in the trisolaran world: a human being a computer. "
"Ha, I think that is the most untrue!" said the vice president of IT.
"I have conducted a simple test with hundreds of employees in the company. Even if this idea can be realized, the calculation speed of a human column computer may be slower than a person's manual calculation."
Pan Han said with a mysterious smile: "Yes, but if the 30 million soldiers that make up the computer, each person can wave the black and white flag 100,000 times in a second, and the speed of the light cavalry on the bus is several times the speed of sound. Even faster, the result is different.
You have just asked about the appearance of the Trisolaran. According to some indications, the appearance of the Trisolaran that constitutes the human column computer may be covered with a layer of total reflection mirror. This mirror may have evolved to survive in harsh sunlight conditions. Yes, the mirror surface can change into various shapes, and they communicate through the light focused by the mirror surface. The transmission speed of the language information of this light is very fast. This is the basis for the existence of the human computer.
Of course, this is still a very inefficient machine, but it can indeed perform calculations that cannot be achieved by humans.
In the three-body world, computers do appear first in the form of humans, and then mechanical and electronic. "
Pan Han stood up and paced around behind the netizens:
"What I can tell you now is: As a game, "Three-body" just borrows the human background to simulate the development of the three-body world. This is just to provide players with a familiar environment, the real three-body world and the game. The difference is great, but the existence of the three suns is real, which is the basis of the natural structure of the Trisolaran world."
"Developing this game must have spent a lot of effort, but its purpose is obviously not profit." said the vice president of IT.
"The purpose of the "Three-Body" game is very simple, to gather like-minded people like us." Pan Han said.
"What ambition and what way?"
Wang Miao asked, but immediately regretted it, thinking carefully whether his question showed a little hostility.
This question really silenced Pan Han. He looked at everyone present one by one with meaningful eyes, and said softly: "If the Trisolaran civilization wants to enter the human world, what is your attitude?"
"I am very happy," the young reporter said, breaking his silence. "What I have seen over the years has made me disappointed in human beings. Human society has been unable to improve itself and needs the intervention of an external force."
"Agree!" said the female writer loudly. She was very excited, and seemed to finally find a chance to vent something, "What is a human being?
What an ugly thing, I have been using the scalpel of literature to expose this ugly for the first half of my life, and now I am tired of this kind of disclosure.
I yearn for the three-body civilization to bring true beauty to this world. "
Pan Han didn't say a word, and the light of excitement lit up in his eyes again.
The old philosopher brandished the extinguished pipe and said with a serious face: "Let's explore this question a little deeper: What impression do you have of the Aztec civilization?"
"Dark and bloody, the bloody pyramid was shining from the gloomy fire in the forest.
This is my impression of it. "The female writer said.
The philosopher nodded: "Very well, then imagine if there was no Spanish intervention later, what impact would this civilization have on human history?"
"You are turning black and white," the vice president of IT said, pointing to the philosopher. "The Spanish who invaded the Americas at that time were just robbers and murderers!"
"Even so, they at least prevented the following things from happening: Aztec developed unlimitedly, turning the Americas into a huge bloody and dark empire, and the era of democracy and civilization in America and all mankind will be later. Come, it won't even appear at all.
This is the crux of the problem-no matter what the Trisolaran civilization is like, their arrival is always a boon to the ill human civilization. "
"But have you ever thought that the Aztec civilization was finally destroyed by Western invaders."
The leader of Guodian said that he looked around at the same time, as if he saw these people for the first time, "The thinking here is very dangerous."
"It's profound!"
The doctoral student raised a finger and said, at the same time he nodded to the philosopher, "I have this idea too, but I don't know how to express it. You said it too well."
After a moment of silence, Pan Han turned to Wang Miao: "The six of them have already expressed their attitude, how about you?"
"I'm on their side."
Wang Miao pointed to reporters, philosophers and others.
If you talk too much, you will lose, he just answered this sentence simply.
"Very good," Pan Han said, turning to the IT manager and the leaders of Guodian, "You two, it is no longer suitable for this party, nor for continuing to play the "Three-Body" game.
Your ID will be cancelled, please leave now.
Thank you for coming, please! "
The two stood up and looked at each other, then looked around in confusion, turned and walked out the door.
Pan Han reached out to the remaining five people and shook hands with them one by one.
Finally, solemnly said: "We are comrades."
