The north wind is like a knife, and the ground is frosty.
On a road near the seashore in the south of the Yangtze River, a group of clearing soldiers armed with knives and guns, escorted seven prison vehicles, rushing northward in the wind and cold.
In the first three prison vehicles, three men were imprisoned separately, all dressed as scholars, one was a white-haired old man, and two were middle-aged.
In the four prison cars behind was a woman, and in the last one was a young woman with a baby girl in her arms.
The baby girl cried endlessly.
Her mother was gentle, and the baby girl just cried.
The soldiers next to the prison car were annoyed, stretched their legs and kicked in the car, and shouted: "Cry again, cry again!
I kicked you to death! "
The baby girl was startled and cried even louder.
There is a big house dozens of meters away from the road, and under the eaves stands a middle-aged scribe, an eleven or twelve-year-old child.
When the scribe saw these scenes, he couldn't help sighing, his eyes were red, and he said, "Poor, poor!"
The kid asked, "Daddy, what crime did they commit?"
The scholar said: "What crime did you commit?
Over 30 people have been arrested yesterday and today, all of whom are well-known scholars in Zhejiang, and all of them are innocent. "
When he spoke of the four "innocent gangsters", his voice was too low, for fear of being heard by the officers and soldiers holding the prison car.
The child said: "That little girl is still breastfeeding, has she also committed a crime?
It makes no sense. "
The scribe said: "You know that the officers and soldiers are unreasonable, really good boys.
Hey, the man is the knife, I am the fish, the man is the wok, and I am the elk! "
The child said: "Father, you taught me a few days ago, "Man is a knife, I am a fish", which means to cut and slaughter others.
They are kitchen knives and chopping boards. We are fish and meat.
Do these two sentences, "Man is a wok, I am an elk", mean the same? "
That scribe: "Exactly!"
Seeing that the officers and soldiers and the prison cart had gone far, they took the child's hand and said, "It's windy outside, let's go back to the house."
Right now the father and son walked into the study.
The scribe dipped his pen in ink and wrote the word "deer" on the paper, saying: "Deer, a beast, is a beast, but it is extremely peaceful. It only eats grass and leaves and never hurts other beasts.
If a ferocious beast wants to hurt it and eat it, it can only run away. If it cannot escape, it can only be eaten by others. "
He also wrote the word "chasing the deer", saying: "So the ancients often used the deer to compare the world.
The people in the world are meek and kind, and they can only bully others.
"Book of Han" says: ‘Qin loses its deer, and the world chases it. ’
That is to say, the Qin Dynasty lost the world, the heroes rose together, and everyone competed. In the end, Emperor Han Gaozu defeated the King of Chu and got this fat and big deer. "
The child nodded and said, "I understand.
In the novel book, it says "compete in the Central Plains", which means everyone is vying to be the emperor. "
The scribe likes it very much, nodded, and drew a tripod on the paper, saying: "The ancients used to cook without a stove and pot. They used such a three-legged tripod to burn wood underneath and caught the deer. Cook and eat in Dingli.
The emperor and the high officials were very cruel, and they didn't like anyone in their hearts, so they said that he had committed a crime and put him in the cauldron.
"Records of the Historian" records Lin Xiangru saying to King Qin: ‘The officials know that the crime of deceiving the king is to be punishable, and the ministers please go to the pot. ’
It means: ‘I’m damned, burn me in the cauldron! ’"
The child said: "Fiction books often say "Ask for the Central Plains", which seems to have the same meaning as "Competing for the Central Plains"."
That scribe: "That's right.
King Xia Yu received the gold from the nine states and cast nine great tripods.
The so-called "gold" at the time was actually copper.
Each tripod is cast with the name of Kyushu and the pictures of mountains and rivers. Those who are the master of the world will retain the Jiuding.
"Zuo Zhuan" said: ‘Chu Zi watched soldiers in Zhoujiang.
Ding Wang, Wang Sun Man Lao Chu Zi.
The size of Chu Zi's aspirations. ’
Only the Lord of the world can keep Jiuding.
Chu Zi was just a prince of the Kingdom of Chu, and the importance of his aspirations was that he was unsuccessful and wanted to take the place of King Zhou instead. "
The child said: "So "Willing for the Top" and "Chasing the Deer" is to be the emperor.
"Unknown who will kill the deer" means that I don't know which one became the emperor. "
That scribe: "Exactly.
Later, the four words ‘Wing Ding’ and ‘Zhulu’ can also be borrowed from other places, but the original Scriptures refer specifically to being an emperor. "
Having said this, he sighed and said: "As the people, we are always a dead end.
"Unknown who will kill the deer", it's just that it's unknown who killed this deer, but this deer is dead. "
He said that he walked to the window and looked out of the window. He saw that the sky was heavy, as if it was going to snow, and he sighed: "How innocent is God, hundreds of innocent people are walking on this frosty road.
It started to snow, but it was tormented again. "
Suddenly they saw two people wearing hats on the southern road, coming side by side, approaching close, and recognizing their faces.
The scribe was overjoyed and said, "It's you Uncle Huang and Uncle Gu who are here!"
He walked out quickly and shouted: "Brother Lizhou, Brother Tinglin, which good wind blows you two?"
The first person on the right is slightly fat, with a black beard under the chin. The surname is Huang, the name is Zongxi, and the name is Lizhou, from Yuyao, Zhejiang.
The first person on the left is tall and thin, with a dark face, his surname is Yanwu, whose name is Tinglin, from Kunshan, Jiangsu.
Both Huang Gu were great scholars in the world. After the death of the Ming Dynasty, they were heartbroken and the country changed. They lived in seclusion and came to Chongde on this day.
Gu Yanwu took a few steps and said, "Brother Wancun, there is an important matter. I have come to discuss with you."
The scribe, whose surname was Liuliang, was named Wancun and lived in Chongde County, Zhejiang Province. He was also a very famous hermit in the late Ming and early Qing.
Seeing Huang Gu's dignified faces, he also knew that Gu Yanwu had always been very dynamic and calm. He said that it was an important matter, but it was naturally no small matter.
At the moment, the two of them were invited into the house and told the child: "Baozhong, go and tell my mother that Uncle Huang and Uncle Gu are here, so cut two plates of mutton ointment and drink."
Not long after, the child Lu Baozhong and his brother Yizhong brought out three sets of chopsticks and put them on the study table.
An old servant served food and wine.
After the three of them quit, Lu Liuliang closed the study door and said, "Brother Huang, Brother Gu, drink three glasses first!"
Huang Zongxi looked bleak and shook his head.
Gu Yanwu poured and drank, and drank six or seven cups in one breath.
Lu Liuliang said: "The two come here, but are they related to the'Ming History' case?"
Huang Zongxi said: "Exactly."
Gu Yanwu raised his glass and chanted loudly:
"'Although the breeze is hard to blow me, why doesn't the bright moon shine on others?"
Brother Wancun, your two poems are really amazing!
Whenever I drink, I will recite this poem, and it will become vain. "
Lu Liuliang had his homeland in mind and refused to be an official in the Qing Dynasty.
The local officials admired his reputation and recommended him as a "mountain and forest retreat", and he was recruited to the DPRK as an official. Lu Liuliang vowed to his death and refused to force him.
Later, another high official recommended him to be a "wise scholar". Lu Liuliang saw that if he refused again, he would be a bit insult to the court and would inevitably kill him, so he shaved his hair as a monk and became a fake monk.
The local officials saw that he was strong, and never persuaded him to leave the mountain.
The two poems "Qingfeng, Mingyue" ridiculed Manqing and missed Qianming. Although they dared not publish them, they had been circulated among like-minded friends, and Gu Yanwu read them again at this moment.
Huang Zongxi said: "It's really a good poem!"
Raised the wine glass and drank a drink.
Lu Liuliang said: "The two are utterly praised."
As soon as Gu Yanwu looked up, he saw a large painting about five feet high and about ten feet wide hanging on the wall. It painted a large landscape with vertical and horizontal strokes and majestic weather. He couldn't help but shouted, and there were only four topics on the painting. A big character: "Such a country", said: "Looking at this path, I think it's Mr. Erzhan's redemption."
Liu Liang said: "Exactly."
The "Er Zhan" surnamed Cha, a famous artist, was a great painter in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties.
Huang Zongxi said, "How about such a good painting without a title?"
Lu Liuliang sighed: "Mr. Erzhan's painting is quite meaningful.
It's just that he is prudent and cautious, neither insignia nor postscript.
He was hovering in the dormitory last month. On a whim, the painting was given to me. How about a few words from both of you? "
Both Gu and Huang stood up and walked to the painting to take a closer look. They saw vast rivers flowing eastward, with countless peaks and mountains on both sides, dotted with strange pine and rocks, but the painting was filled with clouds and the mountains and rivers were beautiful, but it was a sight Down, there was a sudden swelling of air in the chest.
Gu Yanwu said: "In such a country, I have become Yi Di.
I swallowed my anger and surreptitiously, which was really filled with grief and indignation.
Brother Wancun, why not write a poem to express Mr. Erzhan's meaning? "
Lu Liuliang said: "Okay!"
Take off the painting immediately and spread it on the table.
Huang Zongxi studied ink.
Lu Liuliang drew up his pen and pondered for a while, and then he scribbled straight on the painting.
The poem is completed in an instant, the poem goes:
"It's the Southern Crossing of Song Dynasty? It's shameful to be so.
Is it after Yashan? So Jiangshan couldn't bear to look at it.
I have begun to comprehend the meaning of painting, crying bitterly.
Seeing the past and the present from the present, you don't need a mouthful to swallow.
The painting Jiang Gaoyu Xitai tears, researched into Danqing and draws brush strokes.
So there are pictures but no poems, poems are all in four characters.
It is said that he was born at the beginning of Hongwu, and he was limping and walking.
After the mountains and rivers have opened up, where is not ecstasy? "
After the book, I threw a pen to the ground and couldn't help crying.
Gu Yanwu said, "It's a wonderful remark."
Lu Liuliang said: "This poem is very implied, and it is not good. It just writes out the original intention of Mr. Erzhan, so that people who view the painting can learn it."
Huang Zongxi said: "When the old country shines, when'the mountains and rivers open up, so the walls are over', even if the mountains and rivers are poor, they can still be viewed with a great heart. The so-called'where to climb is not ecstasy'!"
Gu Yanwu said: "This poem is so wonderful!
One day we will get rid of the Hulu and return me to the great Han. It will express our grief and indignation, and it will be even more breathtaking. "
Huang Zongxi slowly rolled up the painting and said, "This painting is too hard to hang. Brother Wancun must properly collect it.
If it was seen by an adulterer like Wu Zhirong and the government investigated it, Brother Wancun would be troublesome, and Mr. Erzhan was also involved. "
Gu Yanwu patted the table and cursed: "Wu Zhirong, this dog thief, I really want to eat his meat raw."
Lu Liuliang said: "The two were in vain and said there was an important matter.
The scholars of my generation have worked hard to write poems and inscribe paintings, but put aside business.
I wonder how? "
Huang Zongxi said: "I came here for Mr. Erzhan's native Mr. Yihuang.
The younger brother and Brother Gu received information the day before yesterday that Mr. Yihuang was involved in this big case of "Ming History". "
Lu Liuliang said in surprise: "Brother Yihuang is also implicated?"
Huang Zongxi said: "Yes.
The two of me rushed to Yuanhua Town, Haining the night before. Mr. Yihuang was not at home, saying that he was visiting friends abroad.
Seeing that the situation was urgent, Brother Yanwu hurriedly watched Mr. Yihuang’s family evade overnight; remembering that Mr. Yihuang had made friends with Brother Wancun, he came to visit. "
Lu Liuliang said: "He... he didn't come.
I don't know where it is. "
Gu Yanwu said: "He is like in the mansion, come out to meet by himself now.
I have mentioned a poem on the wall of his study. If he returns home, he will naturally understand, knowing where to avoid, and fearing that he does not know the information. It will show up and be held by the public. That would be bad. "
Huang Zongxi said: "This'Ming History' case has caused me almost all of the celebrities in western Zhejiang to suffer.
The intention of the Qing court is so evil, the name of the brother Wancun is too big, brother Tinglin and the younger brother want to persuade brother Wancun to travel far away from home for the time being to avoid the limelight. "
Lu Liuliang said angrily: "If the emperor of the Qing court arrested me to Beijing, and slashed with a thousand swords, he would have to scold him anyway, and he would die with great pain when he got the bad breath in his chest."
Gu Yanwu said: "My brother Wancun is so heroic and dignified, I admire him.
I was afraid that he would not see Emperor Tartar, but died in the hands of ordinary lowly slaves.
Besides, the emperor Tartar was just a child, who knew nothing, and had great power in the hands of officials.
The brothers and Lizhou brothers speculated that this time the "Ming History" case was so fanatical and vigorously vigorous, it was out of the desire to frustrate my Jiangnan scholars. "
Lu Liuliang said: "The two of you have seen quite the same.
Since the Qing soldiers entered the customs, they have been rampant in Jiangbei without hindrance. Once they arrived in Jiangnan, they encountered resistance everywhere, especially the scholars who knew about Huayi's defense and kept making trouble with them.
Obai took this opportunity to severely suppress my Jiangnan scholars.
Humph, the wildfire is endless, and the spring breeze blows again, unless he kills us Jiangnan scholars cleanly. "
Huang Zongxi said: "Yes.
Therefore, we must keep a useful body and deal with Tarzi to the end. If we succumb to the courage of blood for a while, we will fall into Tarzi's calculation. "
Lu Liuliang realized immediately, Huang and Gu braved the cold to look for Yihuang, first they were looking for Yihuang, and the second was to persuade themselves to escape, for fear that they would lose their lives in vain for a while, and my good friends took pains and were very grateful. : "Two good words, brothers dare not follow?
Tomorrow morning, the brothers and family will go out to take shelter. "
Gu and Huang were overjoyed and said in unison: "It should be so."
Lu Liuliang pondered: "But I don't know where to avoid it?"
Feeling that the world is boundless, the world of Tarzi is everywhere, there is really no clean land, and he muttered: "Where is Taoyuan to avoid the Qin Dynasty?
Where can Taoyuan be avoided? "
Gu Yanwu said: "In today's world, there is really a paradise for the paradise, and we can't be alone, go and hide..."
Lv Liuliang didn't wait for him to finish his resignation, but he stood up and said loudly: "Brother Tinglin blamed him for this.
Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, but it is okay to temporarily avoid disasters, but if you go to hide in the peach blossom field, be at ease, and endure the suffering of hundreds of millions of people under the iron hoof of Tarzi, how at ease?
The brothers have failed. "
Gu Yanwu smiled and said, "Brothers have traveled around the rivers and lakes in recent years and have really made many friends.
As far as I can see and hear, not only scholars oppose Tarzi, but there are also enthusiastic heroes everywhere in the traffickers and the Tugu market.
If the Wancun brother is interested, the three of us will go to Yangzhou together. How about the brothers who will introduce you to the fellows? "
Lu Liuliang was overjoyed and said: "Wonderful, wonderful!
Let's go to Yangzhou tomorrow, and the two will sit down. The brothers will tell Zhuo Jing and let her clean up. "
Speaking and hurried in.
Not long after Lu Liuliang returned to the study, he said: "Although there are many legends about the'Ming History' case, the rumors may not be true. Secondly, there are many talkers who are hesitant to say anything.
The brothers live alone, and the details are unknown. What is the cause? "
Gu Yanwu sighed and said, "We have all seen this history of the Ming Dynasty. Among them, there is not much respect for Tarzi.
This book was written by my prime minister Zhu Guozhen. When it comes to Jianzhouwei outside the Guan, how can you be polite to Tarzi? "
Lv Liuliang nodded and said: "I heard that the dealer in Huzhou spent thousands of taels of silver to buy the manuscript of Ming History from Zhu Xiangguo's descendants and publish it in his own name, not wanting to cause such a disaster."
Gu Yanwu said, "Brothers have inquired about the details here." So he originally stated the causes and consequences of the "Ming History Case".
