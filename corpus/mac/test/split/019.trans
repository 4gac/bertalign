14. Childbirth
On this day, Mr. Cheng went to Wang Qiyao after get off work and saw that she was pale and fidgeting. She lay down for a while, stood up for a while, a glass hit the ground, smashed to pieces, and could not take care of it.
Mr. Cheng hurriedly called for a tricycle, helped her downstairs and went to the hospital.
The pain was better at the hospital, so Mr. Cheng went out to buy some food for dinner.
When I returned to the hospital, I was already in the delivery room and gave birth at 8 o'clock in the evening. She was a girl who said she had black hair and long hands and feet when she was born.
It is inevitable for Mr. Cheng to wonder: Who is she like?
Three days later, Mr. Cheng picked up Wang Qiyao's mother and daughter and was discharged from the hospital. When he entered the lane, he naturally attracted a lot of attention.
Mr. Cheng picked up Wang Qiyao's mother one day earlier, set up a shop on the sofa, and prepared washing utensils very carefully.
Wang Qiyao's mother was speechless all the way, watching Mr. Cheng was busy, and suddenly said: It would be nice if Mr. Cheng was the child's father.
Mr. Cheng couldn't help shaking his hand holding something. He was trying to say something, but his throat choked. When he swallowed, he didn't know what to say, so he had to pretend not to hear.
After Wang Qiyao arrived home, her mother had already stewed chicken soup and red jujube longan soup, and served her to her without a word, and she didn't even look at the child as if she was not there.
After a while, someone came to visit, they were all in the alley. They usually just nod their heads and don't communicate. They all come because of curiosity.
Seeing the baby, she kept saying that she was like Wang Qiyao, and wondered who the other half looked like.
Mr. Cheng went to the stove to take a thermos to add water to the guests, but saw Wang Qiyao's mother standing alone in front of the gray window, quietly wiping tears.
Mr. Cheng always thinks that her mother is snobbish. He didn't put him in the eyes in the past. His name was Wang Qiyao downstairs. She refused to open the door, and only asked the old mother to stick out her head and talk back.
At this time, he felt her heart was closer to him, even more understanding and sympathy than Wang Qiyao.
He stood behind her, whispered for a while, and said: Auntie, please rest assured, I will take care of her.
After saying this, he felt that he was also in tears, and quickly picked up the thermos and went back to the room.
A day later, Master Yan came to see Wang Qiyao.
She hadn't been here for a long time, and she had heard her mother Zhang Ma say that Wang Qiyao was happy, and she was walking in and out of the alley with her stomach upright, not afraid of people making jokes.
At that time, both Cummingson and Sasha disappeared, one stayed behind closed doors, the other walked high and high, but a Mr. Cheng came out halfway and came back three times a day.
Although Master Yan didn't know exactly what happened, she thought she knew very well about the women of Wang Qiyao along the way and didn't make a fuss. It was Mr. Cheng who gave her a strange impression.
She could see that his old suit was of good material, and his style was the modern style of the old age.
She guessed that he was a small opening, and the old-know people on the dance floor derive many imaginations from him.
She had seen him several times in her mouth, holding fried stinky tofu in her hand, walking hurriedly, fearing that the contents in her hand would be cold, the oil soaked in the paper bag almost dripping.
Ms. Yan couldn't help being touched, feeling something unforgettable, and secretly even envying Wang Qiyao.
At this time, I heard that Wang Qiyao had given birth, and was moved with compassion. After feeling a bit of the common difficulties of women, she decided to visit her home.
Wang Qiyao's mother saw that Sister Yan's identity was different, and she was a little more pleased, so she made tea and sat down to chat together.
When Mr. Cheng went to work, it was only the three women, young and old, complaining to each other about the pain of production.
In comparison, Wang Qiyao listened more often than talked about it, because it wasn't a production that came from a well-founded source, and he didn't dare to take credit for it.
Ms. Yan and her mother became more and more enthusiastic as they talked about them. Although it was a matter of years ago, they did not forget every bit.
When her mother talked about the hardships of giving birth to Wang Qiyao, she didn't feel touched, and her eyes became red again. She hurriedly told her that she had something to do and avoided the stove.
These two people were left silent for a while.
The baby has eaten enough milk and has fallen asleep, curled up in the candle light, and can't see the figure.
Wang Qiyao lowered her head to pick her fingernails and suddenly raised her head and smiled.
This smile was a bit tragic, and Master Yan didn't feel a bit of sorrow.
Wang Qiyao said: Madam Yan, thank you for not despising me and for coming to see me.
Ms. Yan said: Wang Qiyao, don't say anything like this anymore, who dislikes you?
In a few days I will call Cummison to come to see you too.
Hearing this name, Wang Qiyao turned her face to one side, carrying Master Yan on her back, and after a while she said: Yes, I haven't seen him for a long time.
Ms. Yan was suspicious in her heart, but she couldn't tell, she just talked about getting together again, but it was a pity that Sasha was gone and went to Siberia to eat Soviet bread. However, it would be enough for a mahjong table to make up for the new gentleman. .
Speaking of this, I asked Wang Qiyao what his surname is, how much he is, where he is born, and where he is.
After Wang Qiyao told her one by one, she asked straightforwardly: Seeing that he is so loyal to you, neither of them are considered young, why not get married?
Wang Qiyao smiled again when she heard this. She raised her face and looked at Master Yan and said: What do people like me talk about marriage or not?
Another day passed, and Cummison really came.
Although Wang Qiyao was prepared, it was an accident.
When the two met, they were shocked and speechless.
Her mother was a discerning person, and when she saw this, she walked away, but when she closed the door she fell heavily, unwillingly.
The two of them couldn't hear anything.
This is the first time we have seen each other since we broke up, and it seems to be a hundred and eight thousand years apart.
I've done it countless times in each other's dreams, and the people in those dreams are not very alike anymore. It's better not to dream.
In fact, they have already decided not to think about it, and really don't think about it anymore, but when people arrive in front of them, they realize that they have never let go.
The two were startled for a while, and Cumming went around to the bed to see the baby.
Wang Qiyao refused to watch, Cummison asked why, Wang Qiyao said that not allowing it to watch means not allowing it to watch.
Cummison asked why, but Wang Qiyao said that it was not his child.
The two were silent for a while, and Cumminson asked: Whose is it that is not mine?
Wang Qiyao said: It's Sasha's.
After that, both of them cried.
A lot of bitterness didn't feel it at the time, but they all came to their hearts at this time, thinking, how did they get through it!
Cummingson said repeatedly: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know that I can't make it up 10,000 times, so what can I say without saying sorry?
Wang Qiyao just shook her head, knowing in her heart that I'm sorry if I don't want this, there is nothing left.
After crying for a while, Wang Qiyao stopped first, wiped away her tears and said: It is indeed Sasha's child.
Hearing what she said, Cumminson's tears dried up, and he sat down on the chair, and the two of them stopped talking about the child, as if there was no such person.
Wang Qiyao asked him to make tea by himself and asked him what he did these days, whether he played bridge, and if there was any news about his assignment.
He said that in the past few months, he seems to be only doing one thing, which is queuing.
At 9:30 in the morning, I went to a Chinese restaurant to wait in line for dinner, and at 4 in the afternoon I went to a western restaurant to wait in line for dinner. Sometimes there was a queue for coffee, sometimes a line for paella.
He always lined up alone, and then all the young and old came to the house.
Said it was a famine, but it seemed to be eating from morning till night.
Wang Qiyao looked at him and said: White hair came out of her head.
He said: Why is this eaten?
Obviously, I wanted to figure it out by myself.
Wang Qiyao gave him a white glance and said: Who will sing "Loutaihui" with you!
The time of the past seems to be back again, but the villain on the bed is added.
The sparrow was pecking at some debris on the window sill, and someone slapped the tanned quilt and slapped it.
When Mr. Cheng came back, Cummingson was leaving, and the two passed by on the stairs. They glanced at each other, but they didn't leave any impression.
When I entered the room, I heard Wang Qiyao said that it was Master Yan’s cousin at the bottom of the alley, who used to play together.
Just say how to let people go before dinner.
Wang Qiyao said that there are no good dishes to keep guests.
Wang Qiyao's mother didn't say anything, her face was very ugly, but she was more attentive to Mr. Cheng than before.
Mr. Cheng knew it was not to himself that he was unhappy, but he did not know who it was to him.
After eating, she teased the baby for a while as usual, and watched Wang Qiyao breastfeed her. She put her small fist into her mouth, fell asleep very satisfied, and left.
It was about eight o'clock, and there were people coming and going on the road, and the lights were shining, and there was some radiance.
Mr. Cheng didn't go to take the tram, he walked with his autumn coat on his arm.
He smelled a familiar breath in this night.
The lights make him kind, the kind that resides in his body and mind.
Mr. Cheng is now in a relaxed mood, and the burden of many days is finally relieved, Wang Qiyao's mother and daughter are safe, and he is not bored with the baby as worried.
Mr. Cheng even had a strange excitement, as if it was not the baby who was born, but himself.
The cinema is about to open the fourth movie, which brings a lively atmosphere to the night.
This city still sleeps late, and the energy remains the same.
The three-color lamppost in front of the barber shop is spinning, which is also the heart of the night scene.
The strong aroma of Brazilian coffee came from the door of Lao Dachang, which is a step back in time.
What a lively night!
There are lively desires and satisfactions everywhere. Although it is a little passing, it is also a serious effort and a worthwhile life.
Mr. Cheng's eyes were almost wet, and there was a wonderful throbbing in his heart that he hadn't experienced in a long time.
When Cummison came again, Wang Qiyao's mother did not avoid entering the kitchen. She sat on the sofa and read a comic book of "A Dream of Red Mansions."
These two people are inevitably embarrassed, talking gossip about the weather or something.
The child woke up and cried. Wang Qiyao asked Cumming to hand her a clean diaper. Unexpectedly, her mother stood up, took the diaper in Cumming's hand, and said: How can you tell Mr. You to do such a thing?
Cummison said it didn't matter, he was fine anyway, and Wang Qiyao also said let him take it.
Her mother sank her face and said: Do you understand the rules, he is a gentleman, how can he touch these feces, people are polite to you, and treat you as a person to visit you, you think it is a blessing. If you have to climb your face, this is ignorance!
Wang Qiyao was overwhelmed by her mother's head and face, and she cried.
When she cried, her mother became even more angry. She threw the diaper in her hand onto her face, and then scolded: You shamelessly give you a face, that's why she said she was acting on her own. "from.
If you want to go low, others can't help it!
Having said that, I also shed tears.
Cummingson was deceived. I don't know how it caused this situation. It's not easy not to speak, so I had to persuade: Auntie don't be angry, Wang Qiyao is an honest person...
Her mother laughed when she heard this, and turned her face to him and said: Sir, you are a sensible person, knowing that Wang Qiyao is honest, she is honest, she has to be honest, what if she is not honest?
So what?
Cumming heard that this sentence was originally directed at him, and he couldn't help but stepped back a few steps, and murmured.
At this time, the child burst into tears when she saw that no one was taking care of her for a long time.
Three of the four people in the room were crying, it was really messy.
Cummison couldn't help saying: Wang Qiyao is still in the confinement, so he can't be sad.
Her mother sneered again and again: Wang Qiyao turned out to be in confinement, I don't know, she doesn't have a man, why is confinement, you can tell me the truth!
Speaking of this, Wang Qiyao's tears fell dry. She changed the baby's diaper and fed her milk, and then said: Mom, you said I don't understand the rules, but don't you know the rules yourself?
When you are a guest, saying these uncovered remarks is as if you have something to do with other people. You are violating me!
It's also a violation of yourself, anyhow I'm always your daughter.
Her words stunned her mother. When she was about to speak, Wang Qiyao said again:
The gentleman came to see me because he really valued me. I don’t want to think about it, and you don’t want to think about it. I dare not say anything else in my life, but I always rely on myself. This time I’m tired of waiting for you. I am in confinement, and I will know the reward.
What she said was both to her mother and to Cummings, and both of them were silent for a while.
Her mother wiped away her tears, smiled sorrowfully, and said: It seems that I have been so worried. Anyway, you are about to be out of confinement. I am superfluous here.
After that, they went to pack up and leave. The two of them didn't dare to persuade her. They watched in a daze as she packed up her things, then put a red paper bag on the baby's chest, went out, then went downstairs, and listened to the back door. With a bang, I left.
Look at the red paper bag. It contains two hundred yuan and a golden lock piece.
When Mr. Cheng arrived, Wang Qiyao was already up and cooking dinner in the kitchen.
When asked where her mother had gone, Wang Qiyao said that her father was a little uncomfortable. She was only a few days away from the full moon and persuaded her mother to go back.
Mr. Cheng saw her eyes swollen again, as if she had cried, but it was not easy to ask for no reason, so he had to give up.
That night, it seemed dull for the sake of someone missing.
Wang Qiyao didn't speak very much, and asked her anything but answered the question. Mr. Cheng couldn't help being disappointed, sitting alone reading the newspaper.
After watching for a while, hearing nothing in the room, thinking that Wang Qiyao was asleep, she turned around, but saw her leaning on the pillow, her eyes open, looking at the ceiling, not knowing what she was thinking.
He walked over gently, wanting to ask her what, but she was taken aback, and turned back to ask Mr. Cheng what he wanted.
Her eyes were indifferent and alert, and Mr. Cheng felt that he was a stranger, so he retreated to the sofa and read the newspaper again.
Suddenly listening to the noise in the alley under the window, he pushed the window and looked at it, who turned out to be catching a weasel in the chicken coop.
The man picked up the weasel to accuse it of its sins, and surrounded many people. Then, people gathered around him and walked towards Nongkou.
Mr. Cheng was about to close the window, but he smelled a scent of sweet-scented osmanthus in the air. Although it was not strong, it was refreshing.
He also noticed that the narrow sky above Ping An Lane was completely dark blue.
He felt a little jumpy in his heart, and turned around and said to Wang Qiyao: When the child is full moon, open a full moon bar!
Wang Qiyao didn't answer first, then smiled and said: What kind of full moon wine!
Mr. Cheng said more actively: The full moon is always happy for auspicious things.
Wang Qiyao asked in return: What are you happy about?
Mr. Cheng was questioned by her. Although he was splashed with cold water, he only felt sorry for her.
Wang Qiyao turned over, lay facing the wall, paused for a while, and said: Don’t mention anything about the full moon, just cook a few dishes, buy a bottle of wine, and invite Master Yan and her cousin to have a light meal. They Treated me well and came to see me.
Mr. Cheng became happy again, thinking about cooking a few dishes and what soup to cook, Wang Qiyao always contradicted him, overturning his plan and restarting.
The two of them argued between you and me, and it became a little lively.
That afternoon, Mr. Cheng left work early and bought vegetables to Wang Qiyao. The two put the child to sleep and got busy together, talking while busy.
When Mr. Cheng saw that Wang Qiyao was in a good mood, he was in good mood, and he put the cold basin in various patterns, bordered by purple radishes.
Wang Qiyao said that Mr. Cheng can not only take pictures, but also cook!
Mr. Cheng said: I know the best but you didn't say it.
Wang Qiyao asked: What is the best one?
Mr. Cheng said: Railway engineering.
Wang Qiyao said: I have forgotten Mr. Cheng’s old line of business. After working for a long time, it turned out to be perfunctory by our sideline business, but the true skills are hidden.
Mr. Cheng laughed and said that it was not hidden, but there was no place to take it out.
The two were joking, when the guests came, Sister Yan's cousin and brother entered the door together, both with gifts.
Master Yan is a pound of cashmere, and Cumming is a pair of gold ingots.
Wang Qiyao wanted to say that the courtesy of the gold ingot was too heavy, and she was afraid that Master Yan would mistake her for her courtesy, so she accepted them together and talked about it later.
Everyone looked at the child again, praised her for being so human, and then sat down around the table, just one person.
It was the first time Mr. Cheng and these two met.
Ms. Yan met him, but he hadn't met Ms. Yan. He and Cumming crossed the stairs, and no one could see who was clearly.
At this time, Wang Qiyao gave an introduction, which is considered to be an acquaintance.
Ms. Yan had a good impression of Mr. Cheng before that, and she was extremely enthusiastic, and she was familiar with each other.
Although Mr. Cheng was a little overwhelmed, it was not surprising that he could also accept her kindness.
In contrast, Cummings looked cautious and silent, and didn't eat much food. He just drank warm rice wine. A bottle of rice wine was quickly finished and another bottle was opened.
Mr. Cheng said that he was going to stir fry, but he stood up a little shaken, Wang Qiyao said she was going to stir fry and pressed him to sit down.
He raised his hand and stroked the back of Wang Qiyao's hand on his shoulder, Wang Qiyao instinctively twitched his hand.
Cumming on the other side couldn't help but glance at him with a sharp look.
Mr. Cheng's heart moved, half sober.
Wang Qiyao fryed hot dishes and came up again.
Ms. Yan also became a little bit drunk with eagerness.
She toasted Mr. Cheng a glass of wine, saying that he was one of the few people in the world who was righteous and righteous. She also said that gold is easy to get, and it is hard to get a good one.
The words are a little out of tune, but they are also used to speak truthfully, and it is difficult to speak when they are left alone.
It doesn't count for Master Yan to toast herself, and she encourages Cumming to also toast to Mr. Cheng.
Cumming had to raise his glass too, but he didn't know what to say. Seeing that everyone was waiting, he was anxious, and what he said was even more inconsistent. He said: I wish Mr. Cheng an early marriage.
Mr. Cheng accepted all the orders, all with a "thank you", and then asked Wang Qiyao what he had to say.
Wang Qiyao looked at Mr. Cheng’s eyes very unlike the past and looked like a rascal. I don’t know if it was because of drinking or there were other reasons. Feeling uneasy, she put a soothing smile on her face and said:
Of course, I was the first one to respect Mr. Cheng’s wine. Just as Ms. Yan Cai said, “It’s easy to get gold, but it’s hard to get a good one.” When it comes to confidant, no one here can compare to Mr. Cheng’s treatment of me. Mr. Cheng was my best friend when Wang Qiyao was most embarrassed. Even if Wang Qiyao made 10,000 mistakes, Mr. Cheng would also forgive him. This kindness and righteousness is unforgettable and will never be reported.
Mr. Cheng listened to her only saying kindness, but did not mention the word "love". She also knew that she had borrowed wine to confess her heart to him. She felt infinite emotion or sadness in her chest. The tears almost reached the lower eyelids, just bowed her head. After a while, he smiled reluctantly:
Today is not my full moon, why do you always toast to me, you should respect Wang Qiyao!
So Master Yan took the lead and toasted Wang Qiyao.
But maybe I just said too much, so I didn't speak at this time, only drinking.
Drinking and drinking, Mr. Cheng and Cumming's eyes met again, and they glanced at each other. Although they didn't understand anything, they all planted doubts in their hearts.
I drank too much wine this day. Mr. Cheng didn’t remember how he sent the guests away, and he didn’t remember to wash the dishes. He woke up and found that he was sleeping on Wang Qiyao’s sofa with a thin bed. By the way, there were leftovers on the table, and the whole room was filled with the sweet and sour aroma of rice wine.
The moonlight was shining through the curtains on his face, really cool as water.
He was very peaceful, watching the light and shadow on the curtains, thinking nothing.
Suddenly a voice asked softly: Do you want to drink tea?
He followed the voice and saw Wang Qiyao lying on the bed at the other end of the room, also awake.
The face was in the shadow, and he couldn't see clearly, only a faint outline was seen.
Mr. Cheng didn't feel cramped, but was quiet. He said: It's really this world!
Wang Qiyao smiled silently: I fell asleep on the table, and the three of them carried you to the sofa.
He said: It's also because of pleasure to drink too much.
After a moment of silence, Wang Qiyao said: Actually you are not happy.
Mr. Cheng laughed: How could I be unhappy?
I am really happy.
Neither of them spoke, and the moonlight moved closer.
Mr. Cheng felt like he was lying in the water.
After a long time, Mr. Cheng thought Wang Qiyao was asleep, but he heard her call Mr. Cheng.
He asked: What's the matter?
Wang Qiyao paused and said: Can't Mr. Cheng sleep?
Mr. Cheng said: I just had a good night's sleep.
Wang Qiyao said, you didn't understand what I meant.
Mr. Cheng said: I understand.
Wang Qiyao said: You still don't understand what I mean.
Mr. Cheng smiled: Of course I understand.
Wang Qiyao said: If you understand, you can tell me.
Mr. Cheng said: If you want me to say it, I just say, you mean, now you and I are only one step away, as long as my Mr. Cheng crosses this step, you Wang Qiyao will not say a "no".
Wang Qiyao was surprised that this dumb-looking Mr. Cheng was in fact a deep understanding, but he was a little embarrassed on the face. The commentary said: I know I am unworthy, so I can only wait for Mr. Cheng to propose.
Mr. Cheng laughed again. At this moment, he felt very relaxed physically and mentally, almost as if he was about to float up. He listened to his own voice as if he was listening to someone else's words, and what he said was self-conscious.
He said: To talk about this step, I, Mr. Cheng, have been waiting for almost half a lifetime, but doesn't this mean that we will step over when we step over?
Many things are undesirable.
Wang Qiyao was silent over there. No matter whether she was awake or not, Mr. Cheng just kept talking about herself, as if pouring out all the words that had been accumulated for more than ten years.
He said that he actually understood this principle a long time ago, and if he thought about it, he would be a friend who knows himself and the enemy, and that his life is not in vain;
But when this person is with others, there is something like the old saying that "going against the current, retreat if you don’t advance". If there is no further wish, it is untrue. When you want to enter and cannot enter, you seem to have to retreat. .
After a pause, he suddenly asked: Is Cummingson the father of the child?
Wang Qiyao laughed aloud and said: So what?
So what?
Mr. Cheng was a little embarrassed, and said: Just ask.
The two each turned over and fell asleep in a short while, snoring slightly.
The next day, after Mr. Cheng got off work, he did not go to Wang Qiyao, so he went to find Jiang Lili.
Beforehand, he called her to class and arranged to meet at Tilanqiao.
When Mr. Cheng arrived, Jiang Lili was already standing there, constantly looking at her watch.
It was obvious that she arrived early, but blamed Mr. Cheng for being late.
Mr. Cheng didn't argue with her either. The two found a small restaurant nearby, sat in and ordered good dishes.
As soon as the man turned around, Mr. Cheng fell on the table and cried, tears falling on the white wooden table whitewashed with alkaline water in strings.
Jiang Lili understood most of it in her heart and did not persuade her. She was silent, looking at the opposite wall. The wall was painted with lime water and pale in color.
At this time, Mr. Cheng only cares about venting his own sadness, and ignores the feelings of others. Even a loyal person like Mr. Cheng is extremely selfish and unfair in love.
In front of the people he loves, he is conscientious and cautious, but in front of the people who love him, he has no scruples and looks like a shameless child.
It was this that prompted Mr. Cheng to come to Jiang Lili.
Jiang Lili was silent for a while, then looked back and saw that he was still in tears, and laughed: Why, lost love?
Mr. Cheng's tears gradually ceased, and he sat there silently.
Jiang Lili still wanted to stab him, and seeing how pitiful he was, she changed her tone and said: Most things in the world are the more you think about it, the more you don’t want it.
Mr. Cheng said softly: What should I do if I don't want to?
Jiang Lili became angry when she heard this, and said loudly: Are all women in the world dead?
Isn’t there another Jiang Lili alive?
Is this Jiang Lili just for hearing you cry and she is alive?
Mr. Cheng knew that he was wrong, so he bowed his head and said nothing, and Jiang Lili stopped saying.
The two stalemate for a while, Mr. Cheng said:
I had something to ask you for, but I didn't know how to cry. I'm really embarrassed.
Hearing what he said, Jiang Lili calmed down as well, and said that if you have anything, just say it.
Mr. Cheng said: I can only ask you for this matter. In fact, it may be the most inappropriate, but there is no one else.
Jiang Lili said: What's wrong, please say something quickly.
Mr. Cheng said that she would like to take care of Wang Qiyao a lot in the future. He would never go to her place from now on.
When Jiang Lili heard what he said, she didn't know whether it was anger or resentment. After holding back for a long time, she said: The women of the world are really dead, even me.
Mr. Cheng resisted her ridicule, but Jiang Lili stopped there and said nothing further.
Wang Qiyao waited for Mr. Cheng to come, waited for a few days, but waited for Jiang Lili.
She came from Yangshupu after get off work and adjusted a few cars. Her hair was disheveled, her shoes were all gray, and her voice was hoarse.
He carried a net bag in his hand, filled with fruit, biscuits, milk powder, and a used bed sheet.
When he walked in, he shook out. Wang Qiyao didn't have time to stop it, so he tore it into a pile of diapers.
