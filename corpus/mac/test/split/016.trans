The peculiar dark-skinned woman's plump lips like purple-red grapes make the mistress's lover charming.
Her birth and origin have been deeply buried by the dust of the years.
The yellow damp sand buried her elastic young body, her pod-like full face and deadly tile-blue eyes, blocking her angry, crazy, lawless, and dirty world. Those who are challenging and who are nostalgic for the beautiful world, are full of strong sexual consciousness.
The mistress was actually buried in the black soil of her hometown.
Sheng Cheng's bloody corpse is a shallow willow plank coffin. The coffin is painted with a deep and shallow sauce red color, and the color cannot cover the holes drilled by the longhorn beetle larvae in the willow planks.
But the sight of the black and shiny body of the mistress being concealed by the golden sand is firmly engraved on the screen of my brain, and it will never be sloppyly imaged in the eyes of my consciousness.
I saw what seemed to be a human-shaped hill swelling up on the thick and painful sandy beach with warm red sunlight.
The mistress’s curves are smooth; the mistress’s breasts are towering; the mistress’s rugged forehead is flowing with a small sand stream; the mistress’s sexy lips protrude from the sand, as if calling for a gorgeous dress The unrestrained and unrestrained spirit of seeking truth from facts...
I know that all this is an illusion, and I know that the mistress was buried by the black soil of her hometown.
There are only red sorghums on the wall around her tomb, standing in front of her tomb—if it weren’t for the winter when Wanmu was slaughtered or the solitary sun and spring—you couldn’t even see the horizon, but the nightmare of Gaomi Northeast Township sorghum sheltered Looking at you, making you short-sighted.
Then, lift up your sunflower-like green and yellow face, from the gap of sorghum, to peep into the startling blue heavenly glory!
In the unhappy whimper of the Mokhe River, go and listen to the music that comes from heaven to alert and obsess the soul!
That morning, the sky was clear and beautiful blue, the sun had not yet begun, and the chaotic horizon of early winter was bordered by a dazzling crimson.
Old Geng fired a gun at a red fox whose tail was like a torch.
Lao Geng is the only gunner in Xianshuikouzi Village. He hunts wild geese, hares, wild ducks, weasels, foxes, and sparrows in desperation.
In the early winter and late autumn, the sparrows of Gaomi Northeast Township formed huge dense groups. Thousands of sparrows gathered into a group of brown broken clouds, rolling swiftly against the wild land.
In the evening, they flew back to the village and landed on a willow tree with lonely dead leaves. The wicker was green and yellow, naked and drooping or pointed up, and the branches were full of sparrows.
A touch of the setting sun burned the sky with clouds, and the trees were painted with bright colors, and the black eyes of the sparrow shone like golden sparks.
They kept beating, their wings curled up on the canopy.
Old Geng held up his gun, squinted a triangular eye, and fired the gun with a trigger. The hail-like golden sparrow snapped and fell, and the iron sand flew among the willow branches, making a sound.
The uninjured sparrow thought for a moment, and only fluttered after watching his companions fall to the ground vertically-like shrapnel, shooting into the deep sky.
My father had eaten old sparrows when he was young.
Sparrow meat is delicious and nutritious.
Thirty years later, I followed my brother in the hybrid sorghum experiment field, and fought fiercely and tough against the cunning sparrow.
Lao Geng was in his seventies at that time, alone and enjoying the "five guarantees" treatment. He was a highly respected figure in the village. He was required to come on stage to complain at every complaint meeting.
Every time he complained, he would strip off his shirt, revealing a scar.
He always said: "The Japanese devil stabbed me eighteen times. I was soaked in blood. I didn't die. Why didn't I die?
Relying on the fox fairy to rescue.
I did not know how long I lay, and opened my eyes, with red eyes, the very kind fox fairy was sticking out his tongue, licking my knife wound..."
Old Geng Tau-Geng Shibadao's home provided a fox fairy tablet. At the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution", the Red Guards went to his house to smash the tablet. He held a kitchen knife and squatted in front of the tablet. The Red Guards retreated sullenly. Up.
Lao Geng had already scouted the red-haired old fox's course of action, but he was never willing to fight it.
He watched it grow up with a good fur, thick and fluffy, very beautiful, and sure to sell for a good price.
He knew it fell when he hit it, and he had enjoyed enough in the world of life.
It steals a chicken to eat every night.
No matter how firmly the people in the village put the chicken coop in, it can break it; no matter how many traps it sets, it can avoid it.
In that year, the chicken coop of the villagers seemed to be the fox's food storage.
Lao Geng left the village when the cock cried three times, lying in ambush behind a low earth weir on the edge of the depression in front of the village, waiting for it to return from stealing the chicken.
In the depressions are clusters of thin, half-human reeds. The stagnant water in autumn forms a thin layer of white ice that is barely human. The small yellow-brown reed tassels tremble in the cold air in the early morning, and the distant eastern horizon gradually A strong light cast on the ice, glowing with the moist brilliance of carp scales.
Later, the eastern horizon became brilliant, and the ice and reeds were stained with the brilliance of cold blood.
Old Geng smelled it, and saw the dense reeds wavy slowly like a soothing wave, and soon closed again.
He put the frozen index finger of his right hand to his mouth, haha, and pressed it to the trigger covered with white frost.
It jumped out of the reeds and stood on the white ice.
The ice was red, like it was on fire.
Its thin mouth was frozen with crimson blood, and a piece of hemp-colored chicken feathers stuck to the beard beside its mouth.
It walked gracefully on the ice.
Old Geng snorted, and it stood at attention, squinting at the soil.
Old Geng trembled all over, the vague look of anger in the fox's eyes made him feel guilty.
It swaggered into the reeds on the ice side, and its nest was in that reed.
Old Geng closed his eyes and shot.
The butt of the rifle slammed into the back seat, making half of his shoulder prickly.
The fox rolled into the reeds like a fire.
He stood up, holding the gun, watching the dark green smoke spreading in the clear air.
He knew it was staring at himself hatefully in the reeds.
Standing under the silver sky, his body looked long and big.
A feeling of guilt arose in his heart, and he regretted it.
He thought of the trust the fox had shown him over the past year. The fox knew that he was lying behind the earth weir, but he was still walking slowly on the ice, as if he was testing his conscience.
He shot, undoubtedly betraying this alien friend.
He lowered his head to the reed where the fox had disappeared, and he didn't even look back at the clutter of footsteps behind him.
Later, a piercing cold pierced in from above his belt, and his body jumped forward, turned around, and the soil gun fell on the ice.
A stream of heat squirmed between the waist of the cotton trousers.
Facing him, a dozen people in khaki costumes were forced to come.
They had big guns in their hands, and the stabbings were bright.
He involuntarily exclaimed: "Japan!"
A dozen Japanese soldiers stepped forward and stabbed each of him in the chest and belly.
He let out a mournful cry like a fox courtship, and fell to the ice.
The white ice cracked on his forehead.
The blood from his body scalded the ice beneath him to pits.
In the coma, he felt his upper body scorching hot as if he was scorched by a flame, and his hands were torn the ragged cotton clothes.
He was in a trance when he saw the red fox coming out of the reeds, turning around his body, then squatting in front of him, looking at him sympathetically.
The fur of the fox is brilliant, and the fox's slightly squinted eyes are like two green gems.
Then he felt the warm fur of the fox approach his body, and he waited for its sharp teeth to bite.
He knows that once a person betrays Xinyi, he is not as good as a beast, even if he is killed by it, he will die without complaint.
The fox stretched out Liang Sensen's tongue to lick his wound.
Lao Geng firmly believed that it was the fox who retaliated with virtue that saved his life. I am afraid it will be difficult to find the second person in the world who can survive 18 bayonet.
There must be a panacea on the fox's tongue, and wherever it licks, it immediately feels as comfortable as being coated with peppermint oil, Lao Geng said.
Someone from the village went into the county to sell straw sandals, and came back and said: The Japanese occupied Gaomi City, and the sun flag was planted on the city.
Hearing this news, almost everyone in the village was restless, waiting for the disaster to come.
When everyone was anxious and frightened, two of them were carefree and doing their own business as usual.
Of these two people, one is the aforementioned free hunter Lao Geng; the other is Cheng Mazi, who has been a drummer and loves singing Beijing opera.
Cheng Mazi said to everyone, "What are you afraid of?
What are you worried about?
Whoever becomes an official is also for the people.
If we don’t resist the imperial food or the national tax, let us lie down and kneel down. Who is embarrassed to punish us?
You say, who is ashamed to punish us? "
Cheng Mazi's persuasion calmed many people, and everyone started to sleep, eat, and work again.
Soon, the atrocities of the Japanese came like wind and wind: killing people and repairing artillery buildings, picking up people's hearts to feed wolf dogs, adultery of a 60-year-old lady, and bunches of heads hanging on telephone poles in the county.
Although Cheng Mazi and Lao Geng set an example of carefree, people want to imitate them, but they can't sing the songs they teach. Even in their sleep, people can hardly forget the cruel pictures depicted in the rumors.
Cheng Mazi has always been very happy. The news that the Japanese are coming to looting has greatly increased the number of shit in and outside the village. The peasants who used to get up early to pick up shit seem to be lazy. No one picks up shit everywhere, as if it was done alone. Prepared into pockmark.
He also came out of the village when the rooster crowed three times. He met Lao Geng with a soil gun in front of the village, said hello, and went his own way.
When there was a touch of red to the east, the pockmarked shit basket pointed.
He put down the dung basket, carried the shovel, and stood on the village's southern soil wall, breathing the sweet and cool air, and his throat was itchy.
He cleared his throat and sang loudly, facing the red clouds in the sky: "I'm like a long-dried Hemiao where the rain meets——"
A gunshot sounded.
The ragged felt hat on Cheng Mazi's head was missing, and his neck shrank and plunged into the ditch like a bullet.
The hard frozen ground banged his head against him without pain or itching.
Later, he saw a pile of soot slag beside his mouth, and a dead mouse covered with soot was lying beside a bald broom bump.
He didn't know whether he was alive or dead. He moved his arms and legs a bit, and he could move, but it didn't seem to work well.
Slimy in the crotch.
A wave of horror came to my mind, ruined, and lost, he thought.
He sat up tentatively and reached into his crotch to touch.
He was frightened and waited to feel a red hand, and when he raised it to his eyes, his hand was full of burnt yellow.
His nose was full of the smell of rubbed seedlings.
He put the palm of his hand on the bottom of the ditch and rubbed it, unable to rub it off, and then took the broken broom bump to rub it, and he was able to rub it, when he heard a roar outside the ditch: "Stand up!"
He looked up and saw that the yelling man was in his early thirties, his face was like a slashed face, his skin was burnt, his chin was long, he was wearing a fragrant woolen hat, and he was holding a jet black short gun.
Behind him, there are dozens of standing khaki legs split apart, wide strips of cross-shaped cloth tied on the calves, looking up along the legs, are the slender hips and dozens of exotic pieces. On those faces, those faces have a happy expression like squatting.
A square-sided flag of the sun was drooping under the bright red sunrise, and a bayonet with a green brilliance.
There was a commotion in Cheng Mazi's belly, and the excretion joyously rolled in his coel and intestines.
"Come on!"
The fragrance top hat shouted angrily.
Cheng Mazi tied the cloth belt, hunched his waist and climbed up the ditch, his limbs were so restrained that he couldn't put it in any place, his big eyes were gray, and he didn't know what to say, so he nodded and bowed.
Fragrant's top hat twitched his nose and asked, "Is there a Kuomintang team in the village?"
Cheng Mazi looked at him blankly.
A Japanese soldier was holding a bloody bayonet and shook his chest and face. The cold on the tip of the knife irritated his eyes and belly. He heard his stomach snoring and his intestines twitching frequently. , The more intense excretion pleasure made him dance.
The Japanese soldier yelled and swung the bayonet down. His cotton-padded coat burst in an uproar, and the ragged cotton wool burst out. Along the cracks of the cotton-padded coat, a burst of muscle pain erupted between his chest and ribs.
He squeezed his body into a ball, tears, nasal mucus, stool, and urine almost all came out at once.
The Japanese soldier grumbled again, it was very long, slurping, like grapes.
He prayed painfully for the angry face of the Japanese and burst into tears.
The fragrance hat poked his forehead with a pistol barrel and said, "Don't cry!
Taijun asks you something!
What village is this?
Is it a saltwater mouth? "
He suppressed sobbing and nodded.
"Are there any straw sandals in this village?"
The fragrant woolen hat asked in a kinder tone.
He ignored the pain, and responded hurriedly and flatteringly: "Yes, yes, yes."
"Yesterday, Gaomi Daji, did anyone go to the fair and sell straw sandals?" Xiangse's top hat asked again.
"There are some." He says.
The blood from his chest had already poured warmly onto his stomach.
"Is there something called Pickle Pimple?"
"I don't know... No..."
Fragrant's top hat skillfully slapped him and exclaimed, "Say!
Are there any pickles! "
"Yes, sir."
He sobbed again aggrievedly, "Sir, every family has pickled vegetables, and every household has pickled vegetables in their urns."
"Fuck, what are you pretending to be, and ask if you have anyone called Pickle Pimple!"
The top hat slapped him in the face, cursing, "Diaomin, ask if you have anyone called pickle pimple."
"Yes... No... Yes... No...
Sir... don't hit me...
Don't hit me, sir..."
He was fainted by the big ear scraper and said upside down.
The Japanese said something. The top hat took off the top hat, bowed to the devil, and turned around. The smile on his face disappeared eagerly, he squeezed it into pockmarks, and said with a straight eyebrow: "Lead the way and enter the village. , Find me all the straw sandals."
He remembered the dung basket and shovel thrown on the wall, and tilted his head back involuntarily, and a sharp bayonet came over from the side of his cheek.
He wanted to understand that life was more valuable than dung baskets and dung shovel, so he never looked back, Luo circled his legs and walked into the village.
Dozens of devils walked behind him, and the big leather boots cracked as they stepped on frost and withered grass.
Several dingy dogs lay in the corner of the wall and barked cautiously.
The sky became clearer, and most of the sun was pressing down on the gray-brown land.
The cry of the babies in the village brought out a quiet village with a huge horror hidden.
The neat stepping of the Japanese soldiers resembled the rhythm of drums, shaking his eardrums and hitting his chest.
He felt the wound on his chest hot like a fire, and the feces in his pants were sticky and cold.
He thought that he was so unlucky that no one would pick the shit anymore. He wanted to pick the shit, so he ran into the shit luck.
He felt aggrieved that the Japanese did not understand his obedient attitude.
Hurry up and take them to those few straw sandals, whoever is pickle bumps is unlucky.
I saw the door of the house from a distance. The roof that was pitted by the summer rain was filled with white grass, and the blue smoke was rising from the lone chimney. He had never felt such a strong feeling for the house. Nostalgia, he wants to go home soon after thinking about things, change a pair of clean pants, let his wife sprinkle a little lime on the edge of his chest, the blood is about to run away, clusters of green stars burst out in front of him, his legs are already weak, for a while His nausea crawled from his belly to his throat.
He has never been so embarrassed before, and a good player of Suona in Northeast Township of Gaomi has never been so embarrassed.
He stepped on the floating clouds, two cold tears filled his eyes.
He missed the beautiful wife who was aggrieved because of his pocky face, but had to marry a chicken and a dog and a dog.
In the early hours of the morning, a gunshot shot from outside the village woke up the mistress who was fighting with my grandma in her dream.
She sat up, pounding in her heart, thinking about it for a long time, but didn't figure out whether it was something that happened outside the village, or an illusion in a dream.
The window was covered with light morning light, and the palm-sized windowpane was covered with strange frost flowers.
The mistress felt cold on her shoulders. She tilted her face and saw her daughter and my little aunt lying on her side, snoring asleep.
The sweet and even breathing of the five-year-old girl calmed down the fear in the mistress.
The second grandma thought, maybe it was Lao Geng who was beating some lynx beasts. She didn’t know that this speculation was quite correct, and she didn’t know that when she sat down for a while and pulled the quilt back into the bed, the sharp bayonet of the Japanese was penetrating. With an old and tough body.
The little aunt turned over and rolled into the arms of the mistress. The mistress held her and felt the girl's warm breath blow to her chest.
It has been eight years since the second grandmother was driven out of the house by her grandmother. During this period, the grandfather was deceived to Jinan Prefecture and almost killed her.
Later, my grandfather escaped from the dead and ran home. Grandma lived with his father and the black eyes of the Tiebanhui leader.
Grandpa and Black Eye duel by the salt water river, although they were knocked over to the ground, they aroused the indelible affection in grandma's heart.
Grandma catches up with grandpa and returns to her hometown to revitalize the soju business.
Grandpa washed his hands and put his guns in. He quit his career as a bandit and spent a few years as a rich farmer.
In the past few years, what has long troubled grandpa is the jealousy between grandma and mistress.
As a result of the jealousy, a "three-family treaty" was made: Grandpa stayed at grandmother's house for ten days, and then moved to second grandmother's house for ten days without exceeding the appointment.
Grandpa always strictly abides by the law, because neither of these two women is a fuel-efficient lamp.
The mistress hugged her little aunt, her heart overflowing with sweet sorrow.
She is three months pregnant again.
Women after pregnancy are generally kind and gentle, but also weak and need care and protection.
The second grandma is no exception, she counts the days with her fingers, she is looking forward to grandpa, grandpa will arrive tomorrow...
There was another sharp gunshot outside the village.
