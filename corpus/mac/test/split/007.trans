Wei Xiaobao followed Guan Anji, Li Lishi and other tycoons outside the gate, only two or three hundred people lined up with excitement on their faces.
After a while, the two big men carried the stretcher and lifted Mao Shiba out.
Li Lishi said: "Brother Mao, you are a guest, don't be so polite."
Mao Shiba said: "Long admiring the name of Chief Chen Zuo, really like Lei Guaner, you must be able to see you today, even if... even if you die immediately, then... that is not in vain."
He was still weak in speaking, but his face flushed and he was extremely happy.
Hearing the sound of horse hooves approaching, the dust head rises, and Shi ran over on horseback.
He mounted the passengers three times on horseback, and got off the horse before running close.
Li Lishi waited for the general to go up and talk with the three people, very affectionate.
Wei Xiaobao heard one of them say: "The master of the rudder is waiting in front of you, please come by Brother Li and Master Guan..."
Several people stood and discussed a few words, and the six people including Li Lishi, Guan Anji, Qi Biaoqing, and Taoist Xuanzhen got on the horse and galloped away with the visitors.
Mao Shibahaosheng was disappointed, and asked, "Isn't Mr. Chen coming?"
To his question, no one can answer, everyone can't see the master rudder, and everyone is dejected.
Wei Xiaobao said in his heart: "Isn't someone owed you ten thousand taels?
Or did you lose your wife's pants by gambling?
Your grandma's, her face is so ugly! "
After a long time, a man rode to pass the order, called the names of thirteen people, and asked them to meet the chief rudder.
The thirteen people were overjoyed, flew on their horses, and rushed forward.
Wei Xiaobao asked Mao Shishiba: "Brother Mao, Chief Executive Chen is very old?"
Mao Shiba said: "I... I haven't... I haven't seen it.
Above the rivers and lakes, everyone admires President Chen, but they want to meet him... His elder side is really difficult. "
Wei Xiaobao let out a hey, but said in his heart: "Huh, fuck, so big, what's so rare?
I don't want to see him. "
Qunhao saw this situation, most of the rudder master would not come, but he still hoped in case, stood outside the gate and waited. Some stood for a long time, and then sat down.
Someone persuaded Mao Shiba to say: "Master Mao, you still go to the house to rest.
If our chief rudder arrives, come as soon as possible to invite Master Mao to meet. "
Mao Shiba shook his head and said, "No!
I'm still waiting here.
Mr. Chen Zongruo came here, not waiting outside the door, then... That would be too disrespectful.
Alas, I don’t know if Mao Shiba’s life is fortunate enough to see him as an old man. "
Wei Xiaobao followed Mao Shiba from Yangzhou to Beijing, all the way, listening to his talk, did not look at the figures in the martial arts, but he has always respected this master Chen Zongruo, unconsciously. After being infected, I didn't dare to swear anymore.
Suddenly, there was the sound of hoofs, and someone came. The congregation sitting underground all jumped up. Everyone craned their necks and looked around, hoping that the rudder master would call people to meet again. This time they have their own part.
Sure enough, four more envoys came, and one of them dismounted and clasped their fists, and said: "The master of the rudder will invite Master Mao Shiba and Master Wei Xiaobao to meet him."
With a cheer, Mao Shiba jumped up from the stretcher, but fell into the stretcher again with a cry of "Ouch," and shouted, "Go, go!"
Wei Xiaobao was also very happy, thinking: "People call me'father-in-law' a lot, but no one calls me'Master Wei', haha, I'm'Master Wei Xiaobao'."
The two envoys took the stretcher right away, rode together and walked slowly.
Another messenger gave the mount to Wei Xiaobao, took another horse and followed behind.
The six people walked less than three miles along the main road and then turned into a small road on the right.
Along the way, there are men in twos and threes, sitting or walking, patrolling and guarding.
The leading messenger stretched out the three fingers of the middle finger, ring finger, and little finger to point to the ground. The guards nodded and also reached out to make a signal.
Wei Xiaobao saw that these people had different codes, and he didn't know what they meant.
It took another twelve or three miles, before coming to a courtyard.
A man guarding the door shouted: "Guest here!"
As the door opened, Li Lishi, Guan Anji, and two men who had never met came out, clasped their fists and said, "Master Mao, Master Wei, come here, please, please."
Wei Xiaobao rejoiced, thinking: "My'Master Wei' can't leave after all!"
Mao Shiba struggled to think about it, and said, "I went to see Mr. Chen Zongruo this way, really, really... Ouch..."
Finally unable to support it, he lay down on the stretcher again.
Li Lishi said, "Master Mao is hurt, so don't be polite."
Let the two into the hall.
A man said to Wei Xiaobao: "Master Wei, please come here for a cup of tea. The chief rudder wants to talk to Master Mao first."
At the moment Mao Shiba was carried in.
Wei Xiaobao drank a bowl of tea, the servant took four plates of dim sum, Wei Xiaobao ate a piece, and thought: "This dim sum is far worse than the one in the palace, and it's not as good as the one in the Lichunyuan."
I can't help but look down on the identity of this chief rudder.
But I was hungry, and I ate a lot of these unsightly snacks.
After a meal, Li Lishi and the other four came out again. One of the old man with a gray beard said: "The master of the rudder has invited Master Wei."
Wei Xiaobao hurriedly swallowed the snack he was chewing in his mouth, wiped his hands on the lap of his clothes, followed the four people inside, and came out of a wing.
The old man raised the curtain and said, "'Little White Dragon' Wei Xiaobao, Master Wei!"
Wei Xiaobao was surprised and delighted, thinking: "He actually knows my invented nickname, it must be Brother Mao said."
A middle-aged scholar dressed as a scribe in the room stood up, smiled and said, "Please come in!"
Wei Xiaobao walked into the room, his eyes twirling around.
Guan Anji said, "This is President Chen of the Association."
Wei Xiaobao raised his head slightly and looked at him. Seeing this person's expression was kind, but his eyes were like electricity, and he could not help being startled. When he bent his knees, he bowed down.
The scholar leaned over and stood up, and said with a smile: "Don't be polite."
Wei Xiaobao's arms were lifted by him, and suddenly his whole body became hot and shivered, and he couldn't worship.
The scholar said with a smile: "This little brother captured and killed Obai, the number one warrior in Manchuria, and avenged my countless Han compatriots who died in Obai's hands. Within a few days, he became famous all over the world.
Fame so early, really rare in ancient and modern times. "
Wei Xiaobao had a thick-skinned face. If others praised him like this, he would brag about it, but in front of the rudder master, who was not angry and prestigious, he couldn't say anything.
The chief rudder pointed to a chair and smiled: "Please sit down!"
He sat down first, and Wei Xiaobao sat down too.
Li Lishi and the other four stood with their hands down.
The commander-in-chief smiled and said: "Listening to the eighteenth master Mao said, the little brother used a trick to kill a Qing army officer, Black Dragon Whip Shi Song, at the foot of the Victory Mountain in Yangzhou.
But I don't know how the little brother captured Obai. "
Wei Xiaobao raised his head and touched his gaze. His heart could not help beating, and the nonsense that he was full of snails was completely forgotten in a moment. When he speaks the truth, how will he be favored by Kangxi and how rude is he , How I and the little emperor together to capture him.
It's just that Gu Quan's loyalty towards Kangxi didn't mention the fact that the little emperor made a knife behind Obai.
But in this way, oneself throws the censer ashes to confuse the eyes, raises the copper censer to smash the head, knowing that it is either the third abuse or the second abuse, but he can no longer hide it.
The rudder master listened without saying a word, nodded and said: "That's it.
The martial arts of the little brother and Master Mao are not the same. "
Wei Xiaobao said: "I have learned some kung fu, but I don't have any respect for a teacher.
The old turtle didn't really teach me martial arts, what he taught me was fake kungfu. "
The rudder master, even though he knew well, did not know who the "old tortoise" was, and asked, "Old tortoise?"
Wei Xiaobao laughed and said, "Old Turtle is the husband of Hai, and his name is Dafu Hai.
The Eighteenth Brother Mao and I captured him into the palace..."
Speaking of this, I suddenly felt that something was wrong. I once told the people of the Tiandihui that Mao Shiba and himself were captured by Obai, but now they said that the husband was captured and entered the palace. Isn't the preface wrong?
Fortunately, his ability to lie and lie is not small, and he followed: "This old man was ordered by Obai to capture the two of me, thinking that Obai is a great official, so naturally he can't take it easily."
The chief rudder said in deep thought: "Haidafu?
Hai Dafu?
Among the eunuchs in the womb, is there such a figure?
Little brother, show me the martial arts he taught you. "
No matter how thick-skinned Wei Xiaobao is, he also knows that his martial arts is too unskilled, and said: "The old tortoise taught me all fake kungfu.
He hated me for blinding his eyes, so he tried his best to harm me.
These efforts are shameful. "
The chief rudder nodded and waved his left hand. Guan Anji and the other four all exited the room and closed the door with their backhands.
The chief rudder asked: "How did you blind him?"
In the presence of this heroic chief rudder, Wei Xiaobao only found it very hard to lie, or it was much more comfortable to tell the truth. This kind of situation has never been seen before. How will he poison her husband and kill her now? Guizi, how to pretend to be a little eunuch and so on.
The master rudder was surprised and funny. He brushed his left hand under his crotch, and found that he had a penis and testicles, and he was not a eunuch. He could not help but breathe a long breath and smiled: "Okay. Great, great!
There was a problem in my mind, and I couldn't make up my mind for a long time. It turned out that the little brother didn't get rid of his body and became an eunuch! "
With his left hand patted on the table lightly, he said, "As it should be!
Brother Yin has a successor, and Qingmutang has a master. "
Wei Xiaobao didn't understand what he was saying, but seeing him with a happy expression, he really solved an extremely difficult thing in his heart, and couldn't help being happy for him.
The rudder master walked around the room with his hands in his hands, muttering to himself: "I will do everything the world has done, and everything has never been done before.
Everything is in my mind, it is appalling, and the disputes are so confusing, what's the point? "
Wei Xiaobao didn't understand his words even more eloquently.
The rudder said: "There are only you and me here, don't be afraid of embarrassment.
The martial arts that Hai Dafu teaches you, whether it's true or false, you try to show me. "
Only then did Wei Xiaobao understand that he ordered Guan Anji and the other four to go out to avoid fear of ugliness and see no excuse. He said, "It was taught by the old tortoise, but it's none of my business. If it's too ridiculous, you can scold him. "
The chief rudder smiled and said: "Let go and practice, don't worry!"
Wei Xiaobao then opened the frame and used the small set of "Great Compassionate Chiba Hands" taught by Mrs. Hai. Some of them forgot and some of them still remember.
The rudder master watched intently. After Wei Xiaobao finished his mission, he nodded and said, "From your perspective, it seems that you have learned some of the Shaolin Temple masters, haven't you?"
Wei Xiaobao learned the "big capture" first, so he naturally knew that this skill was even worse. He wanted to hide his clumsiness, but the master rudder seemed to know everything, so he had to say: "Old tortoise also taught me some capture methods, which are used to fight the little ones. The emperor was fighting."
So some of the moves in "The Great Catch" were also performed.
The rudder master smiled slightly and said, "Not bad!"
Wei Xiaobao said, "I knew you would laugh when you saw it."
The chief rudder smiled and said: "It's not laughing at you!
When I saw it, I liked it in my heart. I think you have a good memory and understanding.
Hai Dafu deliberately taught the wrong trick to ‘turn the white horse’s hoof’, but when you switch to ‘carp holding the gills’, you can make changes on your own and don’t stick to death tricks.
That's great! "
Wei Xiaobao had an idea and thought: "The master of the rudder seems to have much higher martial arts than the old tortoise. If he is willing to teach me martial arts, Wei Xiaobao will definitely become a real hero and no longer a fake hero."
Tilted his head to look at him, and at this moment, the rudder master's cold and electric eyes shot straight.
Wei Xiaobao has always been tired and lazy. Even though the queen dowager is so majestic, he dared to face it, but in front of the chief rudder, he did not dare to be presumptuous at all, and his eyes touched him and he immediately took it back.
The rudder master slowly said: "Do you know what our world will do?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Heaven and Earth will fight against Qing and restore Ming, help the Han people, and kill Danzi."
The chief rudder nodded and said: "Exactly!
Would you like to enter my world and be a brother? "
Wei Xiaobao said with joy: "That's great."
In his mind, all the members of the Tiandihui congregation are true heroes. He did not think that he could be a brother in the meeting, and he thought: "Even Brother Mao is not a brother of the Tiandihui. Am I better than him?"
Said: "I'm afraid... I'm afraid I won't be qualified."
All of a sudden, his eyes were shining, and his heart was full of sorrows and losses. I only felt that this windfall from outside the sky was probably not true, but the chief rudder was just joking with himself.
The rudder said: "You want to join the club, but that's fine.
It's just that we are doing a major event against the Qing Dynasty and reviving the Ming Dynasty. We take the Han people's country as the most important thing, and our own net worth and life are light.
Furthermore, the rules in the meeting are very strict. If you commit a crime, the penalty is severe, and you have to think about it. "
Wei Xiaobao said: "Don't think about it, what rules do you have, I just keep it.
Chief rudder, if you join me as you promised, I will die happily. "
The master rudder put away his smile, and said with a serious face: "This is a very important event. It is a matter of life and death. It is not a child's thing."
Wei Xiaobao said, "Of course I know.
I heard people say that heaven and earth will be chivalrous and righteous, doing all earth-shattering things, how can they be children's stuff? "
The chief rudder smiled and said: "It's good if you know it. There are 36 oaths when joining the association, and there are ten bans and ten punishments."
Having said that, his face sank, and he said, "There are some rules. You are still young and you don't need them. But one of them is: ‘My brother, I must be faithful and not lie or swindle.’
Can you do this one? "
Wei Xiaobao was startled slightly, and said, "I dare not lie to your chief rudder.
But to the rest of the brothers, should we tell the truth about everything? "
Zong Ruo said: "No matter the small things, only the big things."
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes.
It's like gambling with the brothers in the meeting, can it be tricked? "
The chief rudder didn't expect that he would ask about this, he smiled slightly, and said, "Although gambling is not a good thing, it can't help but rules.
But you lied to them.
They know that they will beat you, and the rules of the convention will not prohibit you. Wouldn't you be beaten and suffer? "
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said: "They won't know, in fact, I don't have to cheat, and I can win money."
There are a lot of heroes in the world, gambling and alcoholism, it is natural. They have never thought wrong, so the chief rudder ignored him, stared at him for a moment, and said, "Would you like to worship me as a teacher?"
Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and immediately threw himself to the ground, repeatedly kowtow, and said: "Master!"
The rudder master stopped supporting each other this time, so he knocked a dozen heads and said, "Enough!"
Wei Xiaobao stood up diligently.
Zong Ruo said: "My name is Chen and my name is Chen Jinnan.
The three characters ‘Chen Jinnan’ are used in the arena.
Since you worship me as a teacher today, you must know the real name of the teacher.
My real name is Chen Yonghua, always forever, the flower of China. "
He lowered his voice when he said his real name.
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes, the apprentice keeps it in his heart and dare not leak it."
Chen Jinnan talked to him for a while, and slowly said: "You and I have become masters and apprentices, and you don't hide anything from each other.
Let me tell you the truth, you are slick, cunning and deceitful, and you are very different from the character of being a teacher. I really don't like it, so accepting you as a disciple is actually for the sake of the important things of this association.
"Wei Xiaobao said: "The disciple will make good changes in the future. "
Chen Jinnan said: "The country is easy to change, but the nature is hard to change. It is impossible to change much.
You are still young, more temperamental, and you haven't done anything bad.
I must remember my words at the time.
I am extremely strict with disciples. If you have violated the rules of this association, you have wronged your mind, do evil for wrongdoing, and the teacher will take your life, it is easy to turn your back on, and you will never pity. "
Talking with his left hand, he scratched a corner of the table with a sound, rubbed his hands a few times, and sawdust fell down.
Wei Xiaobao stuck out his tongue, couldn't retract it for a long time, and then he couldn't scratch his heart with love, and smiled: "I will definitely not do bad things.
Whenever I do something bad, Master, you just scratch and rub it on my head.
Besides, as long as you do a few bad things, you won’t be able to teach your disciples with this skill, Master. "
Chen Jinnan said: "It doesn't need a few, it's just a bad thing, you and I won't be a teacher or a student."
Wei Xiaobao said: "Can the two pieces come together?"
Chen Jinnan's face was stern, and he said, "You are serious, don't be slick.
One thing is one thing, is there a bargaining for this kind of thing? "
Wei Xiaobao replied: "Yes!"
But I said in my heart: "I did half a bad thing, but what?"
Chen Jinnan said: "You are my fourth disciple, maybe you are my closed disciple.
The affairs of the world will be heavy, and I have no time to accept disciples.
Of your three brothers, two were killed during the battle with Tarzi, and one died in the battle of Taiwan's restoration of the national surname. They were all great men who died for the country.
The teacher's position in the martial arts is not low, and the reputation is not bad, don't lose face for me. "
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes!
But... But..."
Chen Jinnan said: "But what?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "Sometimes I don't want to lose face, but there is no way to lose face.
It's like being unable to beat someone, being caught by someone, and locked in a jujube bucket. When the goods are usually moved around, don't be surprised, Master. "
Chen Jinnan frowned, angry and funny, sighed, and said, "Accepting you as a disciple, I'm afraid it was a big mistake in my life.
But focusing on the world's major events, I had to take a risk.
Little Treasure, there will be another important task later, you will do everything to me, and stop talking nonsense, that's good. "
Wei Xiaobao said: "Yes!"
Chen Jinnan saw that he was hesitant to speak, and asked, "What else do you want to say?"
Wei Xiaobao said: "A disciple always speaks with justification.
I don't want to talk nonsense, but you say that I talk nonsense. Wouldn't it be wronged? "
Chen Jinnan did not want to entangle him any more, and said, "Then you can say a few words less."
I thought: "I don't know how many famous heroes in the world, they are all respectful and respectful in front of me, and they dare not say anything. This silly and weird urchin has such a lot of nonsense."
Stand up, walk to the door, and say, "You follow me."
Wei Xiaobao rushed to open the door, opened the curtain, let Chen Jinnan go out, and followed him to the hall.
