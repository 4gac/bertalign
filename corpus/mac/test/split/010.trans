It was said that Sister Feng was talking with Ping'er, and someone replied: "Uncle Rui is here."
Sister Feng ordered: "Please come in."
Jia Rui was pleased to see you.
When I saw Sister Feng, I smiled and said hello again and again.
Sister Feng also pretended to be attentive to sit and make tea.
Seeing Sister Feng dressed up like this, Jia Rui became more and more upset, and asked, "Why isn't the second brother coming back?"
Sister Feng said, "I don't know why."
Jia Rui smiled and said, "Don't be stumped by someone on the road, and you are reluctant to come back?"
Sister Feng said: "You know that when a man sees one love, there is also one love."
Jia Rui smiled and said, "My sister-in-law is wrong, I am not such a person."
Sister Feng smiled: "How many people like you can have, and I can't pick one out of ten!"
Jia Rui scratched his head with joy.
Then he said: "My sister-in-law is also bored every day."
Sister Feng said, "Exactly.
I only hope that the individual can help me solve my boredom. "
Jia Rui smiled and said, "I am idle all day long.
If you come here every day to relieve the boredom of my sister-in-law, will you? "
Sister Feng smiled and said, "You coax me!
Are you willing to come to me? "
Jia Rui said: "If I lie in front of my sister-in-law, the sky will thunder!
It’s only because people say that my sister-in-law is a stakeholder and can’t be wrong with you at all, so I’m bluffing.
Now that I see my sister-in-law is a painful talking and laughing, why don't I come?
——I am willing to die. "
Sister Feng smiled and said, "Sure enough, you are a sensible person, far better than the two Rong'er brothers.
I think he is so delicate, only if they understand in their hearts that they are actually two idiots, a little unpopular. "
Hearing this, Jia Rui hit her heart more and more, and couldn't help but move forward, staring at Sister Feng's purse, and then asked, "What ring is she wearing?"
Sister Feng said quietly: "Be respectful, don't let the girls see it."
Jia Rui hurriedly backed away like listening to the Buddhist language of Lun Yin.
Sister Feng smiled and said, "You should go."
Jia Rui said: "I'll sit down again, what a cruel sister-in-law!"
Sister Feng said quietly again: "It's not convenient for you to be here in the big sky and day.
You go, wait till the evening wakes up and you come, quietly waiting for me in the west side of the hall. "
Jia Rui heard this, Rude Treasure, and hurriedly asked: "Don't coax me.
But there are so many people there, how can we hide? "
Sister Feng said: "You can only rest assured, I took the little servants from last night off, and the doors on both sides were closed and there was no one else."
Jia Rui was overjoyed when he heard it, and hurriedly left, thinking that he would succeed.
Looking forward to the evening, I really touched the Rong Mansion in the dark, and while hiding the door, I got into the hall.
Seeing that there was no one coming and going in the darkness, the door to Jia's mother had been upside down, only the door to Xiangdong was left open.
Jia Rui listened attentively and saw no one coming for half a day.
Suddenly, when I heard a sound of ‘chug’, the east door was also closed.
Jia Rui didn't dare to say anything anxiously, so he had to come out quietly and shook the door, closing it like an iron bucket.
You can't go out at this time. Both the north and the south are big walls, and there is no climbing if you want to jump.
The room was breezy and empty again. It was the twelfth lunar month. The night was long, the wind was dignified, the muscles and bones were invaded, and it was almost never frozen to death overnight!
It was easy to look forward to the morning when an old lady opened the East Gate first and called for Simon. Jia Rui looked at him with his face behind his back, and ran out with a cigarette on his shoulders.
Fortunately, the weather was still early and no one got up, so they ran home from the back door.
It turned out that Jia Rui's parents died early, and only his grandfather was raised by Confucianism.
Confucianism of that generation was the most severely taught, and Jia Rui was not allowed to take one step further, for fear that he would miss his studies by eating and gambling outside.
Suddenly I saw him not returning all night, and I expected that he would be gambling or gambling when he was out, whoring and staying with prostitutes. Where did you think of this public case?
So I was angry all night.
Jia Rui was also sweating, and she had to come back and lie, only saying: "Go to uncle's house, it's dark, keep me staying all night."
On behalf of Confucianism and Taoism: "I don't want to go out without permission. How did I go privately yesterday?
We should fight accordingly, let alone lying! "
Therefore, he was so fierce that he was beaten down for thirty or forty shots. He was not allowed to eat and told him to kneel in the courtyard to read articles. He must make up for ten days of work class.
Jia Rui froze all night, was beaten again, hungry, knelt down in the wind and read the article, it was painful.
At this time Jia Ruixie's heart has not changed, and she no longer wants Sister Feng to tease him.
Two days later, when I got free, I still looked for Sister Feng.
Sister Feng deliberately complained that he broke his promise, Jia Rui anxiously swore.
Sister Feng, because he was thrown into the net by himself, and unavoidably looked for other ways to make him know how to change, so she asked him to say: "Tonight, don't be there, you are in the empty room in the small aisle behind my house. wait for me.
——Don't rush! "
Jia Rui said: "Is it true?"
Sister Feng said: "Don't come if you don't believe me!"
Jia Rui said: "You must come, you must come!
Death is also coming. "
Sister Feng said, "You go first now."
Jia Rui expected it to be done at night, so he went first.
Here, Sister Feng ordered soldiers to send generals and set a trap.
Jia Rui could only wait for it to be late, but the relatives at home came again and went after dinner. It was already time to hold the lamp that day; waiting for his grandfather to rest, Fang sneaked into Rongfu and waited in the house in the middle of the road. Ants on a hot pan.
It's just that there is no figure in the left waiting, and there is no sound when listening to the right. I am afraid in my heart, and I can't help but wonder: "Don't come, and freeze me overnight?"
As I guessed, I saw a black man coming in.
Jia Rui was determined to be Sister Feng. No matter the indiscriminateness, when the person arrived, he hugged like a hungry tiger and cats hunting rats, and cried, "My sister-in-law, wait for me to die!"
With that, he hugged him to the kang in the house and pulled his trousers with his mouth, yelling "daddy" and "nanny" in his mouth.
As long as the man kept silent, Jia Rui pulled off his pants, trying to push in.
Suddenly the lights flashed, and Jia Qiang was holding a wax table and said, "Who is in this room?"
I saw the man on the kang smile and said, "Uncle Rui is going to fuck me!"
Jia Rui didn't look at it, it was really embarrassing to see it.
Who are you?
It was Jia Rong.
Jia Rui turned around to run, but Jia Qian grabbed him and said, "Don't go!
Now the second aunt Lian has told his wife, saying that you molested him, he temporarily stabilized you here.
The wife heard her anger passed, so she would call me to get you.
Come with me! "
Jia Rui listened, without possessing the body, and only said: "Good nephew!
You just said that without me, I will thank you very much tomorrow! "
Jia Qiang said: "It's worthless to let you go, I just don't know how much you thank me?
What's more, just writing a letter of deed is counted as there is no proof. "
Jia Rui said: "How does this drop the paper?"
Jia Qiang said: "Why don't you write a gambling, you lose a lot of money, borrow a couple of silver, and it's over."
Jia Rui said: "It's also easy."
Jia Qian turned over and came out, paper and pen were ready, used to call Jia Rui to write.
Both of them did a good job and did evil, and only wrote fifty taels of silver, and Jia Qiang put them away.
Then tear up Jia Rong.
Jia Rong gritted her teeth first, and only said: "Tell the people of the clan tomorrow to comment."
Jia Rui kowtowed anxiously.
Jia Qian did a good job and wrote a fifty-two debt.
Jia Qiang said again: "Now if I want to let you go, I am not worried about it.
The old lady's door was already closed.
The master was looking at things from Nanjing in the hall, and that road would be difficult to cross.
Now I have to go through the back door.
To go this way, if you meet someone, even me is not good.
Wait until I go to explore first, and then I will lead you.
You still can't hide in this room, you just pile up things when you are young, waiting for me to find a place. "
After finishing talking, he pulled Jia Rui, still turned off the light, and went out of the courtyard, touching the bottom of the big steps, and said: "It's fine in this nest.
Just squat, don't snort.
Wait until I come. "
After that, the two went.
Jia Rui couldn't help but squat under the steps.
Just about to figure it out, he heard a sound from the top of his head, and a bucket of urine and feces splashed straight down from above, but he accidentally poured his body and head.
Jia Rui couldn't hold back his palm, and hid his mouth in a hurry. He didn't dare to say anything. His head and face were full of urine and shit, and he was fighting coldly.
I saw Jia Qiang running up and calling: "Go, go!"
Jia Ruifang got his life, and ran from the back door to the house in two steps. It was three watchfuls and he had to call the door open.
Seeing his situation, the family asked, "What's the matter?"
I must lie: "It's getting dark and I stumbled and fell in the latrine."
She went to her room to change clothes and wash.
The bottom of my heart thought of Sister Feng playing with him, so I sent it cruelly; thinking about Sister Feng's appearance again, I couldn't wait to hold it in my arms for a while.
Thinking wildly, never closing his eyes overnight.
Since then, even though she missed Sister Feng, she didn't dare to go to Rongfu.
Jia Rong and others often came to ask for silver, but he was afraid that his grandfather would know.
It is lovesickness that is still unstoppable, the situation has added debts, and the daytime work is tight; a person in his twenties, who has not yet married, thinks that Sister Feng will not get a hand, and he can't help but feel a little bit of "finger to tell him"; And run around with cold and anger twice: So if you try to attack three or five times, you will get a sickness without realizing it:
Swelling in the heart, no taste in the mouth, the feet are like cotton, the eyes are like vinegar, the night is burning, the day is tired, the spermatorrhea, coughing and bloody sputum, such as this disease, less than a year ago.
So unable to support, he lay down, closed his eyes and only dreamed upside down, full of nonsense and horror.
Medical treatment is required in every possible way. Medicines such as cinnamon, aconite, turtle, Ophiopogon japonicus, polygonatum odoratum, etc. have been eaten for dozens of kilograms, but nothing happens.
The illness became more serious when the spring came back.
Dai Confucianism was also busy, and medical treatment was sought everywhere, but none worked.
After eating "Single Ginseng Soup", how the Dai Confucian had this power, had to go to Rongfu to find out.
Madam Wang ordered Sister Feng to weigh two by two.
Sister Feng replied: "Qian'er recently prepared medicine for the old lady, and the whole wife said that he kept the wife who sent Admiral Yang to dispense the medicine, but I had asked someone to deliver it yesterday."
Mrs. Wang said: "It's just that our side is gone, you ask someone to ask your mother-in-law, or your brother Jane, find some, put it together and give it to others, eat well, and save your life, too. Your good."
Sister Feng responded and didn't send anyone to look for it.
I only collected some scum and ordered someone to send it, saying: "My wife asked to send it, and it's gone."
Then he said to Mrs. Wang, "I have found them all. I have collected two or two and sent them."
Then Jia Rui was desperate and impatient at this time. He didn't take medicine without medicine, but wasted money and didn't work.
Suddenly on this day, a lame Taoist came to Huazhai, claiming to treat the disease of injustice.
Jia Rui just heard it inside, and yelled straight, "Go and invite that Bodhisattva to help!"
Kowtowing on the pillow.
Everyone had to bring in the Taoist priest.
Jia Rui grabbed it and called "Bodhisattva help me!"
The Taoist priest sighed: "Your disease is not a cure.
I have a baby with you, you can keep this life when you watch it every day. "
After that, take out a mirror that can look at people on both the front and the back.
——The four characters "Fengyuebaojian" on the back,
——Di and Jia Rui said: "This thing comes from the ethereal hall of the illusory realm, made by the Jinghuan fairy. It specializes in the treatment of wicked thoughts, and has the power to save the world.
So I brought him to the world to take care of the clever, handsome and elegant kings and grandchildren.
Never photograph the front side, only the back side, important, important!
I'll collect it in three days and tell you that you are well. "
After that, go for a long time.
Everyone can't keep it.
Jia Rui took the mirror and thought: "This Taoist priest is interesting, why don't I try to take a photo?"
After thinking about it, I picked up the "Treasure Mirror" and took a photo of it from the opposite side, only to see a skeleton standing inside.
Jia Rui hurriedly covered up and scolded the Taoist priest:
"Asshole!
How to scare me!
I will take another picture of what is the front? "
Thinking about it, he took a frontal photo, and saw that Sister Feng stood inside and nodded to him.
Jia Rui was overjoyed, and Dang Youyou felt that she had entered the mirror and had a good time with Sister Feng. Sister Feng still sent him out.
To the bed, "Ai yo," a cry, eyes open, and out came the new mirror, standing still is the opposite of a skull.
Jia Rui was sweating consciously, and she had left a pool of spirits underneath.
When I was not in the heart, I turned the face up again, and saw that Sister Feng was still beckoning him, and he went in again: so three or four times.
This time, when I was about to come out of the mirror, I saw two people approaching, trapped him with an iron lock, and then left.
Jia Rui shouted: "Let me take the mirror and go again—"
Just say this sentence and you can no longer speak.
The apostle next to him saw that he was still holding a mirror to take a picture, and when he fell down, he opened his eyes and picked it up in his hand. At the end, the mirror fell off and stopped moving.
When everyone came up to look at them, they had already breathed, and a large pool of essence was left under the cold and wet body.
Only then was he busy dressing up and carrying the bed, and the Confucian couple cried to death and cursed the Taoist priest: "What demon way!"
He ordered people to set up a fire to burn the mirror.
Just listen to the cries in the air: "Who told him to take a front view!
You regard false as true, why burn me this mirror? "
Suddenly the mirror flew out of the room.
When Dai Confucian went out to watch, he was still the lame Taoist, shouting: "Give back my "Wind Moon Treasure Mirror"!"
With that, he grabbed the mirror and watched him drift off.
The current generation of Confucianism has no choice but to take care of the funeral and report everywhere.
On the 3rd, the scriptures will start, and the quotations will be issued on the 7th.
All of the Jia family came to ask questions.
Jiaxie in the Rong Mansion gave twenty taels of silver, and Jia Zheng also had twenty taels. Jia Zhen in the Ning Mansion also had twenty taels. The rest of the ethnic groups were rich and poor, or one, two, two, three or four.
There were also classmates who shared their capital, and they also made up two or thirty liang.
Although the Confucian Taoism is weak, with this help, it is also rich and rich.
Unexpectedly, at the end of this winter, Lin Ruhai was seriously ill and wrote a book to pick up Daiyu back.
When Jia's mother heard this, she became even more depressed, so she hurriedly helped Daiyu get up.
Baoyu was very uncomfortable, vying for his father and daughter's affection, and it was not easy to stop him.
So Jia's mother decided to send him to Jia Lian, but still asked to bring him back.
As soon as the soil instrument inventory fee should be paid, it is natural to stick to it properly.
After choosing a date quickly, Jia Lian and Daiyu bid farewell to everyone, led his servants, and boarded the boat to Yangzhou.
Be aware, and listen to the next breakdown.
