Judge: Where did you start this book?
——Although it is almost absurd, it is quite interesting to play.
But it is said that when the Nuwa clan made a stone to replenish the sky, he made 36,500 pieces of stubborn stone 12 feet high and 24 feet square on the Wuji Cliff of the Dahuang Mountain. Nawa only used three Six thousand and five hundred yuan, only one piece was left unused and left under the Qinggeng Peak.
Who knows that since this stone has been exercised, the spirituality has been understood, and it can be large or small;
Seeing all the stones can fill up the sky, and because he has no talents alone, he cannot be selected, so he regrets himself and feels sad day and night.
One day just as he was mourning, Russia saw a monk coming from far away, born with extraordinary bones and abundance of gods. They came under the Qingfeng Peak and sat on the ground.
Seeing this bright and clean stone, and shrunk into a fan pendant, it is very cute; the monk put it on his palm and smiled: "The shape is also a spiritual creature!
It’s just that there is no real benefit. You have to engrave a few more words, so that everyone knows that you are a strange thing when they see it, and then take you to the prosperous state, the poetry and the hairpin clan, the blooming willows, and the gentleness. Go there in Fugui Township. "
After hearing this, Shishi was overjoyed, because he asked, "I don't know what word to engrave?
Where to take it?
Hope and beg. "
The monk smiled and said, "Don't ask, you will understand it in the future."
After finishing speaking, I was ready to go, floating with the Taoist, without knowing where to go.
I don’t know how many lives and tribulations have passed, because an empty Taoist man visited Dao for immortality. He passed under the Wuji cliff and Qing ridge of this wild mountain. Suddenly he saw a large stone with clear handwriting and a calendar;
The empty-air Taoist looked from the beginning, it turned out to be a stubborn stone that was incapable of filling the sky and entering the world, and was carried into the red dust by the vast and insignificant real person:
It tells the fallen country, the place of reincarnation, family trivial matters, boudoir leisure, poetry and riddles, but it is also complete.
It's just the age of the dynasty, and there is no test for loss.
There is another verse behind:
No talent can make up the sky, and enter the red dust for a long time;
Who remembers Qian to make a strange story?
The empty-air Taoist looked at it once and knew that the stone had some origins, so he said to the stone: "Brother Shi, your story is somewhat interesting according to your own point of view, so I write it here and want to hear the legend of the world;
In my opinion: the first one is that there is no age of the dynasty to be tested. The second one is that there is no good governance of great sages, great loyalty, court management, and customs. Among them, there are only a few strange women, either affection or infatuation, or young talent. Wei Shan, even if I copy it, it is not a strange book. "
Sure enough, the stone replied: "Why my teacher is too foolish!
I think that the dynasties of unofficial history are nothing more than the name and color of Han and Tang;
As I remembered by this stone, if I don't use this trick, I only follow my own personal feelings, but it is fresh and unique.
Moreover, in that unruly history, either slandered the prime minister, or degraded the wife or daughter, adultery and vicious, innumerable;
There is also a kind of Fengyue pen and ink whose obscenity and smell are the most vulnerable to bad people.
As for books such as talented scholars and beautiful ladies, they also talked about "Wenjun", full of "Zijian", with a thousand parts and a thousand people, and they have to be involved in adultery.
——The author only wants to write two of his own love poems, so he falsely pinches out the names of men and women, and must add a small person to make trouble in the meantime, like a clown in a play.
The more annoying, the ‘whatever’s the same’, irrelevant is literary, very uncomfortable, self-contradictory:
It's not as good as the few women I have seen and heard about in this half of my life. Although I dare not say that they are better than all the people in the previous books, but looking at their deeds, they can also relieve their sorrow;
As for a few crooked poems, you can also spray rice for wine;
In the meantime, the joys and sorrows, the ups and downs, follow the path, and I dare not go through it a little bit to lose the truth.
I only hope that when people wake up after drunk, or when they avoid troubles and sorrows, they will not only wash the old and renovate, but also save some lifespan and energy, and will not try to seek falsehood.
What does my teacher mean? "
Hearing this, the empty-air Taoist thought for a while, and then reviewed the "Story of the Stone" again.
Seeing that the main purpose above is nothing more than a love story, it is only a true record of the matter, and there is no disease of sexual intercourse at the time of injury, so Fang copied it from beginning to end and heard about the legend.
From then on, the empty and empty Taoist people were born in space, sent emotions into sex, sent emotions into sex, and went to the sky, so they changed their name to Love Monk, and changed "Stone Record" to "Love Monk".
The inscription of Donglu Kong Meixi is "Fengyue Baojian".
To Wu Yufeng inscribed "A Dream of Red Mansions".
Later, because Cao Xueqin was in the mourning red hall, he read it for ten years, added and deleted five times, compiled it into a catalog, divided into chapters, and inscribed "Jinling Twelve Hairpins" with a title.
Until Zhiyanzhai copied and reviewed, the "Stone Record" was still used.
This is the origin of "The Story of the Stone".
Shiyun: Paper full of absurd words, a handful of bitter tears.
Duyun, the author is crazy, who understands it!
The origin of "The Story of the Stone" is clear, but I don’t know who and what is written on the stone. Please listen to the judge——
Press the stone on the book cloud:
The land was sinking to the southeast. There was Gusu City in the southeast. Changmen in the city was the first and second-class rich and romantic place in the red dust.
There is a Shili Street outside Changmen, Renqing Alley in the street, and an ancient temple in the alley. Because the place is narrow, people call it "Gourd Temple".
Next to the temple lived a village eunuch, whose surname was Zhen, Fei, and the character was hidden; his wife was appointed by his wife, who had a virtuous temperament and a deep understanding of courtesy and justice;
Although the family is not very rich, he is regarded as a prominent family locally.
Because of his indifferent nature, Zhen Shi did not recite his merits, he only enjoyed watching flowers, planting bamboo, drinking wine and singing poems every day, and he was a first-rate immortal figure.
There is only one shortcoming: over half a hundred years old, there are no children under her knees, only one woman named Yinglian, three years old.
One day in the hot summer and eternal day, the scholar sits in the study room, throws a book with tired hands, dozes a few times, and walks to one place in a dimness, not knowing where it is.
Suddenly, I saw a monk in that room, let's talk.
Just listen to the Taoist asking: "Where do you want to go with this thing?"
The monk smiled and said, "Don't worry!
Now there is a period of romantic affair, and it is time to end. This dry enemy has not yet been reborn into the world, so I took this opportunity to entrain this thing in it and let him experience the experience. "
That humanity said: "It turns out that the romantic enemy will be plundering the world again recently, but I don't know where it started?
Where did it fall? "
The monk said: "This matter is funny.
Only because the stone was not used by the emperor Wa, but he was at ease. He went to play everywhere, and came to Jinghuan fairy one day. The fairy knew that he had some origins, because he left him in Chixia Palace and named him. It is the waiter of the God Ying of the Chixia Palace.
However, he often walked on the banks of the Western Ling River and saw a ‘Crimson Pearl Grass’ on the bank of the Ling River. It was very charming and lovely. Then he was irrigated with nectar, and this ‘Crimson Pearl Grass’ was prolonged for a long time.
Later, after being nourished by the essence of heaven and earth, regained the nectar, he got rid of the womb of plants and trees, transformed into a human form, only cultivated into a female body, traveled all day outside the "lihengtian", hungry for the "secret fruit", thirsty for the "sorrowful water" .
Because the virtue of irrigation has not yet been repaid, even the five inner parts are lingering and inexhaustible. They often say: ‘I have benefited from his rain and dew, and I have no such water to return.
If he is a man in this world, I will go with him, but it will be fine to return all the tears of my life to him. ’
Therefore, in one matter, how many romantic friends have to go down to the earth to create a fantasy relationship, and the pink pearl fairy grass is also among them.
Today, this stone is due to be born. I have come to bring him to the Jinghuan Fairy case, register him, and go down to the earth with these ghosts and settle the case. "
That humanity said: "The fruit is funny, I never heard the saying of'returning tears'!
Taking advantage of this, why don't you and I also get off a few in the next world? Isn't it a merit? "
The monk said: "It's just what I want.
You go with me to the womb of Jinghuanxian to deliver this ‘stupid’ clearly, and when this dry evil spirit is born, you and I will go again.
——Half of it has fallen into the dust now, but it is still not complete. "
Taoist said: "Since this is the case, let you go."
But she said that Zhen Shiyin could understand, so she couldn't help but stepped forward to give a salute, and asked with a smile: "The two immortals have invited."
The monk was also busy answering questions.
Shi Yinyin said: "It is good to hear about the cause and effect of the immortal master, but it is rare in the world;
But the disciple was foolish and couldn't understand.
If Meng is stubborn and obsessed with obsessiveness, take a closer look, and disciples will be able to listen carefully, and be a little alert and avoid the suffering of sinking. "
The second immortal smiled and said: "This is a mystery, and it cannot be predicted.
At that time, just don't forget me and you can jump out of the fire pit. "
Shiyin listened to it, and it was inconvenient to ask again, because he smiled and said, "Mystery cannot be revealed, but Shiyun is a'stupid', I don't know why?
Or is it available? "
The monk said: "If you ask about this thing, there is a fate."
Said to take out and pass and Shiyin.
When Shiyin took a look, it turned out to be a bright and beautiful jade with distinct handwriting on it, engraved with the four characters "psychic precious jade".
There were a few lines of small characters behind. When he was about to read it carefully, the monk said, "I have reached the illusion," and he snatched it from his hand, and passed the big stone archway with the Taoist man. It is "Too Unreal Realm";
There is another couplet on both sides:
False is true when it is true and false, and there is no place for nothing.
Shi Yin wanted to follow along. When Fang moved his steps, he heard a thunderbolt like a landslide. Shi Yin yelled. When he fixed his eyes, he saw the scorching sun and bananas, and half of the dream was forgotten.
Seeing the grandmother hug Yinglian walking.
Shiyin saw that his daughter was becoming more and more in a jealousy, so he felt gratifying, so he reached out and hugged him in his arms to fight him for a while, and then took him to the street to see the excitement of the meeting.
When Fang Yu came in, he saw a group of monks from over there: the monk's head was stomped, the lame and unkempt, mad, squandered, talked and laughed.
When he arrived at his door, he saw Shiyin holding Yinglian, the monk burst into tears, and said to Shiyin: "Benefactor, what do you do with this lifeless thing that affects your parents? "
Shiyin heard it, knowing it was crazy, and didn't ignore him.
The monk also said: "Leave me alone!
Leave me alone! "
Shi Yin was impatient, and turned around holding his daughter before going in. The monk pointed at him and laughed, and said four words in his mouth, saying:
Used to coquettishly laugh at you, Ling Huakong confronts Xueliang.
After the Lantern Festival, it is time for smoke to extinguish the fire.
Shiyin understood, he hesitated, and wanted to ask him where he came from.
Just listen to the Taoist saying: "You and I don't have to go together, just break up and go for a living.
After the Three Tribulations, I will wait for you in Beiman Mountain. "
The monk said: "The most wonderful, the most wonderful!"
After that, the two went away, and they were nowhere to be seen.
Shi Yin thought to himself at this moment: These two people must have a history, it is time to ask him, but now it is too late to regret.
This man was thinking about it, and suddenly saw a poor scholar living in the Gourd Temple next door, his surname Jia, Shifei, and Yucun came by.
This Jia Yucun was originally from Huzhou, and was also a family of poets and officials.
Because he was born in the last days, the roots of his parents and ancestors have been exhausted, and the population is declining. He is only left with one mouthful. There is no benefit in his hometown. Because he entered Beijing to seek fame and fame, he will continue his career.
Since the year before, he has been drowned again, temporarily sent to the temple to settle down, and sells writing and writing for a living, so Shiyin often handed over with him.
When Xia Yucun met Shiyin, he hurriedly said with a smile: "The old man is leaning on the door and waiting, dare there be any news on the market?"
Shi Yin smiled and said, "No.
Because the little girl cried and led him out to play,
——It is very boring, Brother Jia came just right, please enter the small fast, and each other can eliminate this eternal day. "
When he said that, he sent his daughter in, brought Yucun to the study, and the child offered tea.
After talking about three to five sentences, the family reported: "Master Yan is here to worship."
Shi Yin hurriedly got up and thanked him: "Forgive you for your crimes, and please sit down, and my brother will come to accompany you."
Yucun got up and gave in, "Old gentleman, please.
Late birth is a frequent visitor, so why not wait. "
Said Shiyin had left the front hall.
Here in Yucun, I was fiddled with poems to relieve boredom, and suddenly I heard a woman coughing outside the window.
Yucun then got up and looked out. It turned out that a maid was pinching flowers there:
The appearance of the students is good, and the eyebrows are beautiful, although they are not very attractive, they are also attractive.
Yucun was dumbfounded.
When the maid of the Zhen family pinched Hua'er and was about to leave, she suddenly looked up and saw someone in the window:
The old clothes of the turban, although poor and embarrassed, were born with a round waist and a thick back, a wide mouth, sword eyebrows, star eyes, straight nose and square cheeks.
The maid hurriedly turned around to avoid, thinking to herself:
"This life is so majestic, yet so shabby. My family has no such poor relatives or friends.
I think he must be the Jia Yucun that the master often said, and strangely said that he must not be a long-dead person, and he always intends to help Zhou Ji, but there is no chance. "
Thinking about it this way, I can't help but look back once or twice.
Seeing him turning back, Umura thought that this woman was interested in him, and was overjoyed, saying that this woman must be a hero with big eyes and a confidant in the dust.
When the child came in, Yucun asked to leave a meal in front of him, not to stay for a long time, and then went out through the freeway in the lane.
After Shiyin's hospitality was gone, knowing that Yucun had gone, he would not invite again.
One day when the Mid-Autumn Festival came, the Shiyin family banquet was over, and another table was set in the study, and he walked to the temple to invite Yucun.
It turned out that Yucun had met the Zhen family maid and reviewed him twice since that day. He claimed to be a confidant, so he always kept it in mind.
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and I can't help but have cherished feelings for the moon.
Unexpected wish for three lives, often add a period of worry
When I was bored, I grabbed my amount and looked back a few times.
Regarding the shadow of the wind, who can be worthy of the moon?
Chan Guang, if he intended, first went to the jade head.
Yucun chanted, because he was thinking about life's ambitions, and the time was not right, but he scratched his head and sighed at Tianchang again, and replied:
Jade seeks a good price in the cemetery, and the chai waits for time to fly.
Just when Shiyin came to hear him, he smiled and said, "Brother Yucun is really ambitious!"
Yucun hurriedly smiled and said, "I don't dare, but I recited the words of the predecessors.
Because of the question: "Where is the old man?"
Shi Yin smiled and said: "Tonight, Mid-Autumn Festival, it is commonly called the festival of reunion. I want to respect my brother and send it to the monk's house. It is not without a sense of loneliness. Therefore, I have a special drink to invite my brother to our house for a drink.
After hearing this, Yucun didn't decline, and said with a smile: "How dare you give this kind of hospitality even if you are adored."
With that said, the fellow fellow came back to the academy here.
After the tea is finished, the cups and plates have already been set. Needless to say, the wine and delicacies.
The two returned to their seats, first drinking slowly and drinking slowly, and then they talked to Xingnong, and then they flew forward.
At that time, the family in the neighbourhood was in charge of the flute, and the households sang songs, and the bright moon was in the first round, and the color was bright and bright.
Yucun is already 70 or 80% drunk at this time, and he can't help but feel cherished by the moon.
Every three or five will be reunion, full of Qingguang guard jade fence.
It was only held in the heavens, and the people in the world looked up.
Shi Yin yelled, "Wonderful!
My brother said that my brother must not be the one who has lived for a long time. I have already seen the phrase that I chanted, and I will be able to take it on the clouds in a few days.
Congratulations, congratulations! "
Congratulations by pouring a fight.
Yucun drank dry and suddenly sighed: "If you are not a late-born drunk man, if you talk about fashion, you can also make a name for the late-born.
It’s just that now there’s nothing to do with luggage and travel expenses. Shenjing has a long way to go. It’s only by selling words and writing articles—"
Shi Yin didn't wait to finish, and said: "Brother, why don't you say it earlier!
My brother has had this intention for a long time, but every time I met my brother, he didn't talk about it, so he didn't dare to be abrupt.
Now that this is the case, although my younger brother is not talented, he still knows the word ‘yili’;
And if you are happy for the next year, your brother should be quick to enter the capital, and you will live up to what your brother has learned.
The brother will take care of the rest of the cost, and it is not in vain of his brother's wrong knowledge. "
At the moment, the boy was ordered to go in and seal fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothes, and he said: "The 19th is the period of the zodiac, brother can buy a boat and go west.
Wait for Xiongfei to hold high and meet again in the next winter. Isn't it a great thing! "
Yucun accepted the silver clothes, but thanked him a little and didn't mind, he was still drinking and talking.
Three drums have been handed that day, and the two have separated.
After Shiyin sent Yucun to the village, he went back to his room for a nap until he woke up after the red sun.
Thinking about what happened last night, I wanted to write two letters of recommendation and take it to the capital with Yucun, so that Yucun would vote for an official's home as a place to stay. When someone came to ask, the family returned and said:
"The monk said that the Five Drums of Master Jia has entered Beijing today, and he also left a message with the monk to convey to the master, saying:'The scholar is not in the zodiacal and underworld, and he always depends on affair and it is too late to resign.'"
Shiyin had no choice but to listen.
It's really easy to spend leisure time, and suddenly it is the Lantern Festival.
Shiyin asked his family, Huo Qi, to hug Yinglian and go to see the spark lights.
In the middle of the night, Huo Qiyin wanted to clarify, so he sat Yinglian on the threshold of a house. When he finished his fascination and hugged him, was there a trace of Yinglian?
Anxious Huo Qi searched for it in the middle of the night, until dawn, Huo Qi didn't dare to come back to see his master, so he fled to another country.
Seeing that their daughter did not return all night, the Nasyin couple knew something was wrong;
I asked a few people to look for it, and when I came back, there was no impact.
The husband and wife only gave birth to this daughter for half a lifetime. Once lost, how troublesome they are, so they cry day and night, almost regardless of their lives.
Look at January, Shiyin has already got the disease first, and his wife Fengshi is also ill because of thinking about his daughter, so he asks the doctor every day.
I don't want to see the confession exploded in the gourd temple on March 15th, and the monk was not careful, and the window paper burned in the oil pot.
This person’s furniture used bamboo fences and wooden walls, which is what the calamity should be, so he was involved one after another, burning a street like a mountain of flames; even though soldiers and civilians came to rescue at that time, the fire was already in force, how to save Got it?
It burned for a whole night, and I don’t know how many people were burned.
Only the poor Zhen's house is next door. It has long since become a pile of rubble. Only his husband and wife and several family members have never been injured. The anxious Shi Yin only stumbled and sighed.
Discuss with his wife and live in the farm.
In recent years, the floods and droughts have not been cured, thieves and thieves have been swarming, officers and soldiers have been arrested, and the farm is difficult to settle, so the fields have to be broken, and he took his wife and two maids to his Yue Zhang's house.
