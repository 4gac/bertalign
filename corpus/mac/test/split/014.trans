My father finished a piece of cake, stepped on the decayed grass that was shining bloody by the setting sun, walked down the river bank, and stepped on the soft beach full of green water and grass, carefully walking to the side of the river and standing there.
The first of the four cars on the Great Stone Bridge in Moshui River had a tire punctured by a chain rake and lay there blankly. The rails and baffles of the cars were covered with blue blood and green brains.
The upper body of a Japanese soldier was lying on the railing, the helmet on his head fell off and hung on his neck.
The black blood dripping from the tip of his nose landed in the helmet.
The river was sobbing and weeping.
The sorghum was sizzling mature.
The heavy and stagnant sunlight was shattered by the small waves on the river.
Autumn insects wailed in the damp soil under the roots of the water plants.
The burnt black frame of the third and fourth cars screamed and cracked.
My father watched in the chaotic sound and the intricate colors, saw and heard the ripples and the crisp sound of a stone chime caused by the blood dripping from the tip of the Japanese soldier's nose in the helmet.
My father is a little over fourteen years old.
In 1939, the sun was exhausted on the ninth day of the eighth month of the ancient calendar. The ashes and ashes stained everything in the world. After a day of fierce battle, the thin face of his father became even thinner with a layer of purple mud.
The father squatted down on the body of Wang Wenyi's wife, drank water with both hands, and the viscous water drop swayed from his fingers, falling silently.
When my father’s cracked lips touched the water, the soaked lips stinged, and a bloody smell rushed through the teeth into his throat. In a moment, his throat spasm became straight and hard, and after several hiccups. , The throat is relieved to a normal state.
The warm ink river water enters the father’s throat, moisturizing the dryness, and causing his father to produce a painful pleasure. Although the bloody smell makes his stomach churning, he continues to drink water into his throat until the river water soaks through his stomach. He straightened up and let out a sigh of relief when he found the cracked crumb cake.
The sky is definitely going to be dark, and the red sun is only left with a blush painted on the lower edge of the super-wide dome. On the big stone bridge, the burnt smell of the third and fourth cars is also a little weak.
A loud noise made my father surprised. He looked up and saw that the broken car tires after the explosion fluttered down the river like a black butterfly, and the black, white, and white oriental rice that was shaken up was also sprinkled on the plate. Like the river.
When his father turned around, he saw Wang Wenyi's little woman lying on the edge of the river, bleeding a piece of the river with her blood.
Climbing up the river bank, his father shouted: "Father!"
Grandpa stood upright on the river bank, the flesh on his face was consumed in a day, and the outline of the bones protruded from under the scorched skin.
Father saw that in the verdant twilight, Grandpa's half-inch-long upper finger hair was clearly whitening little by little. In the heart of his father, he leaned forward timidly and gently pushed Grandpa and said:
"Father! Father!
What happened to you? "
Two lines of tears flowed on Grandpa's face, and a string of rattling noises rolled in Grandpa's throat.
The Japanese machine gun that Captain Kai En of the cold detachment dropped was like an old wolf, lying in front of his grandfather's feet, with a trumpet-shaped muzzle like enlarged dog eyes.
"Father, talk, daddy, eat bread, and drink some water after you eat bread. If you don't eat or drink, you will die of thirst and starve to death."
Grandpa's neck folds forward, his head drooping to his chest.
His body seemed to be unable to withstand the weight of his head, and he slowly and slowly became short.
Grandpa squatted on the river bank, held his head in his hands, moaned for a moment, then raised his head and shouted:
"Bean officer!
My son, my man, is that over? "
The father looked at grandpa dumbfounded.
My father’s eyes opened wide, and from those two diamond-like pupils, the brave and unruly ringing spirit that originally belonged to my grandma diffused, and the light of hope in the dark kingdom illuminated my grandpa’s Heart.
"Father," said my father, "don't worry, I will practice the gun, like you did when you were fishing around Shuiwanzi. If you practiced a seven-point plum spear, I went to Leng Mazi, a bitch's bastard. account!"
Grandpa jumped up and roared three times, half like crying and half laughing.
From the center of his lips, a ray of purple blood flowed out.
"Yes!
Good point, son! "
Grandpa picked up the crumbs made by my grandmother from the black soil and swallowed it. The brown teeth were covered with crumbs and blood foam.
The father heard grandpa choking with the cake, and saw the angular cake pieces slowly creeping down his throat.
The father said: "Father, you can drink some water down the river to bubble the cake in your stomach."
Grandpa staggered down the river embankment, knelt on the grass, stretched out his long neck, drinking like a mule or horse.
After drinking the water, his father saw his grandfather spread his hands and plunged his entire head and half of his neck into the river. The river encountered obstacles and aroused clusters of bright waves.
Grandpa put his head in the water and soaked half a bag of cigarettes--
My father looked at his father who was like a copper toad on the embankment, and his heart was tight--
Grandpa Hulala raised his soaked head, panting heavily, stood up, went up the embankment, and stood in front of his father.
The father saw water droplets rolling down on Grandpa's head.
Grandpa shook his head and threw out forty-nine droplets of various sizes, like a pearl.
"Guan Dou," Grandpa said, "with Dad, let's go see the brothers!"
Grandpa staggered through the sorghum fields on the west side of the road, and his father followed him.
They stepped on the broken tortuous sorghum and the faintly yellow copper bullet shell, bending their heads from time to time, looking at the players who were lying on their backs and grinning.
They were all dead. Grandpa and father pulled them, hoping to meet someone alive, but they were all dead.
The hands of father and grandpa were covered with sticky blood.
Father saw the two team members on the westernmost side. One had a muzzle of soil, and there was a large piece of rottenness in the nape of the neck, like a smashed honeycomb; the other was prone to the ground with a sharp knife stuck in his chest.
Grandpa looked at them, and his father saw their broken legs and broken abdomen.
Grandpa sighed, drew the soil gun from the player, and tore the sharp knife from the player's chest.
Father followed his grandfather across the road that was brightened by the gloom of the sky, and in the same sorghum field on the east side of the road, he looked at the brothers one by one.
Liu L was still kneeling there, holding big trumpets in both hands, keeping the posture of playing.
Grandpa shouted excitedly: "Liu L!"
Tuba did not say a word.
Father went up and pushed him, and shouted: "Uncle!"
The big horn fell to the ground, and when he looked down, the trumpeter's face was already stiff like a stone.
In the sorghum field where the damage was not too serious and dozens of steps away from the river embankment, grandpa and father found Fang Qi, who had been beaten out of his intestines, and another member named "Tube IV" (he was ranked four, after an hour) Tuberculosis), tuberculosis was shot in the fourth thigh, and he passed out due to excessive bleeding.
Grandpa put his blood-stained hand on his lips.
I can still feel a burning and dry breath from his nostrils.
Fang Qi's intestines have been stuffed into his stomach, and a handful of sorghum leaves are stuck in the wound.
He was also saving things. When he saw his grandfather and father, he twitched his lips and said, "Commander... I'm done...
You met my wife... Give her some money...
Don't let her remarry...
My brother has no queen...
She is leaving...
The Fang family broke the incense..."
The father knew that Fang Qi had a more than one-year-old son, and that Fang Qi's wife had a pair of tits the size of a gourd, and the milk was strong, making a child fresh and tender.
Grandpa said: "Brother, I will carry you back."
Grandpa squatted down and dragged Fang Qi's arm to his back. Fang Qi screamed. His father saw that the sorghum leaves that blocked Fang Qi's wound had fallen off, and the white intestines were filled with warmth. The stench came out of the wound.
Grandpa put Fang Qi down, and Fang Qi wailed repeatedly: "Big Brother... Alright...
Don't toss me...
Give me a shot..."
Grandpa squatted down, holding Fang Qi's hand, and said, "Brother, I will carry you to find Zhang Xinyi, Mr. Zhang, he can heal red injuries."
"Big brother... hurry up...
Don't let me suffer...
I'm not good at it..."
Grandpa squinted, looking up at the chaotic August twilight sky studded with dozens of dazzling stars, and gave a long roar, and said to my father: "Man, is there still fire in your gun?"
The father said: "There is more."
Grandpa took the revolver that his father handed him, opened the mechanism, looked at the yellow light, and turned the wheel of the gun.
Grandpa said, "Seventh brother, don't worry, you can leave. If I have food for Yu Zhanao, I won't be hungry for my sister-in-law and nephew.
Fang Qi nodded and closed his eyes.
Grandpa is holding a revolver, like a huge boulder, and his whole son trembles under the weight.
Fang Qi opened his eyes and said, "Big Brother..."
Grandpa shook his face fiercely, and a ball of fire burst out from the muzzle, lighting Fang Qiqing's scalp.
Half-kneeling Fang Qi quickly planted forward, leaning on his intestines.
My father couldn't believe that there were so many intestines in one's stomach.
"'Tube Four', you should also go all the way, die early and reincarnated, come back and work with these Dongyang bastards!"
Grandpa put the only bullet left in the revolver into the heart of the "Tube Four" whose life is hanging by a thread.
After the murderous grandfather killed "Tube Four", his revolver fell to the ground, his arm hanging down like a dead snake, and he could no longer lift it up.
Father picked up the pistol from the ground, inserted it in his waist, and jerked at his drunken grandfather, and said, "Father, go home.
Dad, go home..."
"Go home, go home?
Come back home!
Go home..." Grandpa said.
The father took Grandpa, climbed up the river bank, and walked awkwardly westward.
Most of the new moon on the ninth day of August has hung in the sky. The cold moon shines on the backs of grandfather and father, and illuminates the river of ink, which is as heavy as the great and clumsy Chinese culture.
The white eel, excited by the bloody water, was flying and swirling in the river, and silver arc lights leaped back and forth across the river.
The blue cool air coming up in the river and the red warm air diffused in the sorghum fields converge on the embankment, forming a light and transparent mist.
My father remembered the thick rubbery fog that was as flexible as rubber when he set out in the early morning. This day was as long as ten years and as short as an eyelid.
My father remembered that his mother was standing on the village head to see him off in the thick fog. The scene was far away in the sky, close in front of him.
He thought of the difficulty in marching in the sorghum field, of Wang Wenyi being hit by a stray bullet in his ear, and of fifty or so team members driving into the bridge like sheep shit on the highway, and the dumb's sharp waist knife, the eyes of the yin bird, in the air The flying devil's head, the old devil's shriveled butt...
The mother who fell down on the riverbank like a phoenix spreading her wings... The cake... The cakes rolling everywhere... The red sorghum falling one after another... The red sorghum falling like a hero...
Grandpa picked up my father who was walking while he was asleep, and used one injured arm and one uninjured arm to embrace the bends of my father's legs.
The revolver in his father's waist was stuck on Grandpa's back, and grandpa felt a great pain.
This is the revolver of the adjutant who is black, thin, handsome, and asked by the university.
Grandpa thought that this gun killed the adjutant Ren, and also killed Fang Qi, "Tube Si", Grandpa wanted to throw it into the Heishui River, this ominous fellow.
He was just thinking about throwing it, but his body bowed, and his son who was sleeping on his back was pushed up, also to relieve the painful pain.
Grandpa walked, he could no longer feel where his legs were, but with a strong intention to walk, he struggled with difficulty in the turbid waves of the rigid air.
Grandpa was groggy and heard a wave of noise coming from the front.
When I looked up, I saw a long, fiery dragon winding on the embankment in the distance.
Grandpa stared for a moment, and there was a mist in front of him. When he was in the mist, he saw the long dragon with teeth and dancing claws, clouds and mist, and the trembling golden scales fell to the ground, and the wind roared and the clouds flickered, lightning and thunder, ten thousand sounds gathered, like a majestic wind sweeping the female. world;
When it was clear, it was identified as ninety-nine torches, crowded by hundreds of people running over.
The flames fluttered, illuminating the sorghum in Henan and Hebei.
The torch at the front shone on the people behind, and the torch at the back shone on the people in front.
Grandpa put his father down on his back and shook it vigorously, shouting: "Dougan! Dougan!
Wake up!
Wake up!
The folks came to meet us, the folks came..."
Father heard grandpa's voice hoarse; father saw two brilliant tears that popped out of grandpa's eyes.
Grandpa was twenty-four years old when he assassinated Shan Tingxiu and his son.
Although my grandma and him are in harmony with him in the sorghum field, in the solemn process of half pain and half happiness, although my grandma is also pregnant with my mixed merits and crimes, she is after all the romantic father of Gaomi Northeast Township, but that At that time, grandma was married to the Ming media of the Shan family. Grandpa and her were always the best of Sang Jian Pu, with a considerable degree of randomness and instability. Besides, my father did not settle down. So, I wrote about what happened at that time, I would call him Yu Zhanao more accurately.
At that time, my grandmother Yu Zhanao said that her legal husband, Shan Bianlang, was a leper. Yu Zhanao cut off two sorghum trees with that sharp sword. He wanted my grandma to go back without worry in three days. He meant me. Grandma couldn't think about it, grandma was confused by the wave of love.
He had a murderous heart then.
He watched my grandma drill out of the sorghum field, and from the crevices of the sorghum he saw my grandma summoning a smart little donkey, kicking up the drunk great-grandfather.
He heard my great-grandfather stiffly say: "Girlfriend... You... You have been peeing for a long time...
Your father-in-law... wants to give us a big black mule..."
Regardless of her nonsense dad, grandma lied to the donkey in her lap, and turned a pink face swept by the spring breeze to the sorghum field on the south side of the road.
She knew that the young bearer was watching herself.
Grandma struggled from the excitement of tearing her liver and cracking her gallbladder, vaguely seeing a new and unfamiliar wide road paved with red sorghum diamond-like grains in front of her eyes, in the ditches on both sides of the road , Preserves the clear and gasy sorghum liquor.
On both sides of the road, there are still red sorghum groups that are frank and intelligent. The red sorghum in reality and the red sorghum in grandma's hallucinations are integrated, and it is difficult to distinguish between true and false.
Grandma was full of ethereal, solid, clear and fuzzy feelings, and she walked far.
Yu Zhanao held the sorghum in his hand and watched my grandma turn the corner.
A moment of tiredness came up, and he shoved back to the altar just now, fell down like a wall, and fell asleep snoringly.
When I slept until the red sun subsided, I first saw the sorghum leaf stems and sorghum ears coated with a thick layer of purple.
Putting on his clothes, he walked out of the sorghum field, and the sorghum screamed as the wind galloped on the road.
He felt a little chill coming up, and forced his clothes to wrap tightly.
I accidentally touched my belly with my hand, and felt hungry in my belly.
He remembered in a daze that when he carried the woman into the village three days ago, he saw a tattered wine flag under the eaves of the three straw houses at the village head beckoning in the storm. The hunger in his stomach made him unable to sit and stand. Steady, bold, out of the sorghum field, strode towards the hotel.
He thought that he had been employed by the "Wedding and Funeral Service Company" in Dongbei Township for less than two years, and people nearby would not know him.
Go to the village hotel to eat and drink enough, take a chance, and when you are done, you will walk away and enter the sorghum field, just like a fish entering the sea and taking a leisurely trip.
Thinking of this, facing the sun, wandering westward, I saw the swelling clouds above the setting sun, like peony and peony blooming, the clouds are all inlaid with golden rims, which is terribly bright.
Walked west for a while, then went north, and went straight to the village of Shan Bianlang, my grandma's husband.
The fields have long been quiet and no one is there. In those years, all the farmers who could eat their mouthfuls returned home early, and did not dare to fall in love with the night. At night, the sorghum field became a world of green forests.
Yu Zhanao had good luck in those days, and he didn't run into the trouble of the stubborn hero looking for him.
Smoke was already rising in the village, and there was a handsome man on the street carrying two crock pots of fresh water from the well platform, dripping water from the pitcher.
Yu Zhan'ao flashed into the thatched house with the broken wine flag. The house was always connected without a partition wall. A counter made of mud and slabs divided the house into two halves. Inside was a large kang, a stove, and a large cylinder.
There are two Eight Immortals tables with crooked legs and cracked faces outside, and a few narrow wooden stools are carelessly pushed around the tables.
A green-glazed wine jar was placed on the mud counter, and the wine handle was hung on the edge of the jar.
A fat old man was leaning up on the big kang.
Yu Zhan'ao glanced at him and immediately recognized that the old man called "Korean sticks" and his career was to kill dogs.
Yu Zhanao remembered that once he saw him on Madianji where he killed a dog in half a minute. Hundreds of dogs on Madianji saw him standing upright and barked, but they never dared to approach him.
