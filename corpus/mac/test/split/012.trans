It is said that after Baoyu had been raised for 33 days, not only was his body strong, but also the sores on his face were healed, and he returned to the Grand View Garden.
This is no problem.
Let’s talk about the recent season of Baoyu’s illness, Jia Yun took the housekeeper and took care of him, staying here day and night;
The little red maid guarding Baoyu was also here.
Seeing each other more and more, gradually getting acquainted.
Xiaohong saw that Jia Yun was holding a piece of silk in her hand, it seemed that she had fallen before, and it was difficult to ask him later.
Unexpectedly, the monk and Taoist had come, and he didn't need any men, so Jia Yun still planted trees;
This matter can't be put down until it is left, and it is afraid of people's suspicion when it is asked.
At the moment of hesitation and uncertainty, I suddenly heard the question outside the window: "Is my sister in the house?"
Xiaohong heard it and looked out of the window. It turned out that it was Jiahui, a little girl in this hospital. Because she replied, "At home, you come in."
After hearing that Jia Hui ran in, she sat on the bed and said with a smile: "I'm good fortune!
After washing things in the yard, Baoyu asked to send tea to Miss Lin and Sister Hua gave it to me.
Coincidentally, the old lady gave Ms. Lin money, and she was sharing it with their girls. Seeing me there, Ms. Lin grabbed two of them and gave them to me.
I don’t know how many, you keep it for me. "
He opened his handkerchief and poured out the money to Xiao Hong.
Xiaohong counted one five to ten for him.
Jia Hui said: "How do you feel in your heart these past few days?
According to me, you have to stay at home for two days, ask a doctor to come and see, take two doses of medicine and it will be fine. "
Xiaohong said: "What about there?
Okay, what do you do at home? "
Jia Hui said, "I remember.
Miss Lin is weak, and he often takes medicine, and you ask him for some, the same is true. "
Xiaohong said: "Nonsense!
Medicine is also mixed? "
Jia Hui said: "You are not a long way, and you are lazy and lazy, how about the end?"
Xiaohong said: "What are you afraid of?
It's better to die earlier and clean it up. "
Jia Hui said: "Well, how do you say these words?"
Xiaohong said: "You know what's in my heart!"
Jia Hui nodded, thought for a while and said, "But I can't blame you.
This place is difficult to stand.
Just like yesterday, the old lady was ill because of Baoyu. These days, she said that the people who served in the service had worked hard, and now she is well, and there are still wishes everywhere, so that everyone who follows will wait and reward them.
We are considered young and can't get up, so I don't complain; how come you are not included in it?
I was not convinced.
Even if he takes a lot of attacking people, he doesn't bother him, it should be.
Speaking of conscience, who can compare to him?
Not to mention that he is always diligent and careful, even if he is not diligent and careful, he cannot fight.
Only Qi Qingwen Qixia and the others are considered to be in the upper class, lying down on Baoyu to hurt them, everyone is holding them.
Are you angry? "
Xiaohong said: "I can't get angry with them either.
As the saying goes: ‘Build a long shed for thousands of miles—there is no permanent feast. ’
Who will keep it forever?
But in three or five years, everyone did their own things, and then who was in charge of who? "
These two sentences touched Jia Hui's heart unconsciously, and her eyes were red, and she was embarrassed to cry for no reason, so she reluctantly smiled: "What you said is.
Yesterday, Baoyu also said: How to clean up the house tomorrow and how to make clothes.
It seems to have been suffering for hundreds of years. "
Xiao Hong sneered, and she was about to speak, only to see a little girl who hadn't kept her head coming in, holding some flowers in her hand and two pieces of paper, and said: "You can describe these two flowers. ."
With that, Xiang Xiaohong pushed down, turned around and ran away.
Xiaohong asked outside: "Whose is it?
Can't wait to finish and run.
‘Who is waiting for you to steam the steamed buns-afraid of getting cold? ’"
The little girl only said outside the window: "It's sister Qi."
Lifting his foot, Gudong Gudong ran away again.
Xiaohong pissed off and put that aside, looking for a pen in the drawer.
After searching for a long time, they were all bald, because they said, "Where did Qianer put a new pen?
Why can't I remember? "
While talking, thinking about it for a while, Fang smiled and said, "Yes, Ying'er took it the night before."
Yin Xiang Jiahui said, "You took it for me."
Jia Hui said: "Big Sister Hua is still waiting for me to take the box for him, so you can take it yourself."
Xiao Hong said: "He is waiting for you, are you still sitting idle and knocking your teeth?
I won't ask you to take it, and he won't'wait' for you anymore.
Broken little hoof! "
He said he came out of the room.
After leaving the Yihong Courtyard, I went straight to Baochai Courtyard.
As soon as I arrived at the Qinfang Pavilion, I saw Baoyu's nanny Li, coming from there.
Xiaohong stood still and smiled and asked, "Grandma Li, where did your old man go?
How to call here? "
Mother Li stopped, slapped her hand, and said, "You said, well, you have also taken a fancy to that ‘Brother Yun’ and ‘Brother Rain’. This moment forced me to call him.
Minger called to the room to hear, but it was not good. "
Xiaohong smiled and said, "Does your old man really believe him to call?"
Mother Li said, "How about it?"
Xiaohong smiled and said, "If the one knows what's good or bad, he won't come in."
Mother Li said: "He is not stupid, why doesn't he come in?"
Xiaohong said: "Since you are coming in, your old man should not come with him;
Come back and ask him to be alone and see how he is! "
Mother Li said, "I have such a great time to go with him!
But I told him, come back to send a little girl, or an old woman, bring him in and it's over. "
Saying that, he took a turn and went.
When Xiao Hong heard that, she stood in a daze and didn't take the pen.
Not long after, I saw a little girl running up, and seeing Xiao Hong standing there, she asked: "Sister Hong, what are you doing here?"
Xiao Hong looked up and saw that it was the little girl's pendant.
Xiaohong said: "Where to go?"
Luo Er said: "Tell me to bring in Erye Yun."
With that, he ran away.
Here Xiaohong just walked to the door of Fengyao Bridge, and saw that the pendant led Jia Yun to come.
Then Jia Yun glanced at Xiao Hong while walking; that Xiao Hong only pretended to talk to Sui'er, and glanced at Jia Yun:
The four eyes are facing each other. Xiao Hong blushed unconsciously and turned to Hengwu Courtyard.
Not to mention.
Here Jia Yun came to the Yihong Courtyard with Zhui'er, and Zhui'er went first to find out, and then Fang led Jia Yun in.
When Jia Yun looked at it, she saw a few rocks in the courtyard, planted with plantains, and two cranes over there, picking feathers under the pine trees.
Hanging on the corridor of a slip of all kinds of cages, caged immortal birds and different birds.
There are five small rooms on the top that are engraved with fresh patterns on the fan. There is a plaque hanging on it with four large characters, and the inscription is: "Yihong, fast and green."
Jia Yun thought: "The strange road is called'Yihongyuan'. It turns out that these four characters are on the plaque."
As I was thinking, I just listened to laugh through the screen window and said: "Come in!
Why did I forget you for two or three months! "
Jia Yun heard Baoyu's voice, and hurriedly entered the room. When she looked up, she saw magnificent and brilliant articles, but she couldn't see Baoyu there.
When I turned my head, I saw a large full-length mirror standing on the left. From behind the mirror turned out two pairs of fifteen or sixteen-year-old girls, and said, "Please sit in the house, Erye."
Jia Yun didn't even dare to look straight, and quickly agreed.
Entering another Bisha kitchen, I saw a small lacquer-filled bed with a big red and golden tent.
Baoyu is wearing home-made clothes and shoes, leaning on the bed, holding a book;
Seeing him coming in, threw down the book, stood up with a smile early.
Jia Yun hurriedly stepped forward to ask Ann, Baoyu let her sit, and sat down on a chair below.
Baoyu smiled and said: "I only saw you from that month, I told you to come to the study, who knows that there are many things in succession, and I forgot you."
Jia Yun smiled and said: "Always I have no good luck, but I am unhappy when I meet my uncle.
Is Uncle Daan now? "
Baoyu said: "That's great.
I heard that you worked hard for several days. "
Jia Yun said: "The hard work is also deserved.
Uncle Daan is a good luck for our family. "
With that, I saw a maid serving tea with him.
When Jia Yun talked to Baoyu in her mouth, she looked at the maid:
Slim body, long face, wearing silver red jacket, green satin waistcoat, white silk pleated skirt.
Since Baoyu fell ill, Jia Yun has been in it for two days, and he has recorded half of the famous people;
He saw this maid and knew it was an attacker.
He was different from others in Baoyu's room. Now he brought tea, Baoyu was sitting next to him again, and he stood up hurriedly and said with a smile: "How can my sister pour me tea?
I came to my uncle, not a guest, waiting for me to fall down. "
Baoyu said: "Just sit down.
The girls behaved the same way. "
Jia Yun smiled and said: "Though that, the sisters in the uncle's house, how dare I be presumptuous."
While talking, sit down and have tea.
Then Baoyu said to him some non-essential prose:
He also said who has a good actor and a good garden, and told him whose girl is beautiful, whose banquet is rich, who has strange goods, and who has foreign objects.
Jia Yun had to follow him.
After speaking, seeing Baoyu being a little lazy, he got up and said goodbye.
Baoyu didn't stay too much, just said: "You can come tomorrow when you are free."
Still ordered the little girl to send it out.
Jia Yun came out of Yihongyuan, and saw that there was no one around, she stopped slowly, talking to Sui'er with long and short mouths.
Ask him first: "How old are you?
What's your name?
Where are your parents?
How many years have you been in Uncle Bao's house?
How much is a month?
How many girls are there in Uncle Gong's house? "
When she asked, she told him everything.
Jia Yun said again: "The one who was talking to you just now is called Xiaohong?"
Zhui'er smiled and said, "His name is Xiaohong.
What are you asking him to do? "
Jia Yun said: "He just asked you what silk, I picked one upside down."
Lue'er listened and smiled: "He asked me several times: Someone saw his silk.
Where do I take care of these things so much?
Today he asked me again, and he said that I found him for him and he thanked me.
I just said it at the entrance of Hengwuyuan, the second master heard it too, it was not I who lied.
Good second master, once you have chosen it, give it to me, let me see what he can do to thank me. "
It turned out that when Jia Yun came to plant trees last month, she picked a piece of Lopa, knowing that the people in this garden were lost, but she didn't know who belonged to it, so she didn't dare to make a mistake.
Today, I heard Xiaohong asked Zhuier, knowing that it was his, and I was very happy.
Seeing Luoer's pursuit again, I had an idea early in my heart, so he took out one of his own pieces from inside his sleeve, and smiled to Xianger: "I'm giving it to you. You want his thanks, don't hide it from me. "
Luo Er agreed with her mouth, took the silk, sent Jia Yun out, and came back to find Xiao Hong.
Now let's say that after Baoyu sent Jia Yun away, he was lazy, lying on the bed, seemingly hazy.
Xiren walked up, sat on the edge of the bed and pushed him, and said, "Why do you want to sleep again?
You are so bored, can't you go out for a stroll? "
Baoyu said, holding his hand and smiled: "I want to go, but I just can't bear you."
Xiren smiled and said, "You have nothing else to say!"
While speaking, he pulled him up.
Baoyu said: "Where can I go?
Weird and annoying. "
Xi Ren said: "Just go out.
No matter how trivial it is, I become more bored. "
Baoyu was not good enough to play the lottery and had to rely on him.
He shook out the door, and fiddled with Que'er on the corridor. After leaving the courtyard, he followed the Qinfang River and looked at the goldfish.
I saw two deer on the hillside over there running like arrows.
Baoyu didn't understand what it meant, and was wondering to herself, only to see Jia Lan coming from behind with a small bow.
Seeing Baoyu in front, he stopped and said with a smile: "The second uncle is at home, I just want to go out."
Baoyu said: "You are naughty again.
Okay, what do you shoot him for? "
Jia Lan smiled and said, "I won't go to school this time, what are you doing?
So exercises, exercises, riding and shooting. "
Baoyu said, "Knocked my teeth, so I won't act at that time."
As he said, he walked to the front of a courtyard and looked at the phoenix tail. Long Yin said: It was the Xiaoxiang Pavilion.
Baoyu walked in, only to see Xiang curtain hanging down, quietly silent.
When I walked to the window, I felt a faint fragrance shining from the green screen window.
When Baoyu put his face on the screen window and looked at it, he suddenly heard a long sigh in his ears, and said, "'Everyday family, love, sleep and faint!'"
After Baoyu heard it, he felt itching in his heart.
When I looked again, I saw Daiyu stretching on the bed.
Baoyu smiled outside the window and said, "Why do you feel sleepy and dizzy every day?"
On the one hand, he opened the curtain and came in.
Daiyu consciously forgot his emotions and blushed, covering her face with her sleeve, turning over and pretending to be asleep.
Baoyu just stepped up and wanted to pull his body, but Daiyu's nanny and two wives followed, and said, "My sister is sleeping. Please wait until you wake up."
Just as she said, Daiyu turned over and sat up, smiling: "Who is sleeping?"
Seeing Daiyu's rise, the two or three women smiled and said, "We are only a girl asleep."
After speaking, he called Zijuan and said, "The girl wakes up, come in and wait on her."
On the one hand, all went.
Sitting on the bed, Daiyu raised her hand to tidy her sideburns, and smiled at Baoyu and said, "I'm sleeping, what are you doing in here?"
Seeing his star-eyed eyes and red cheeks, Baoyu didn't realize that his soul was dying early. He leaned forward and sat on the chair, smiling, "What did you say?"
Dai Yu said, "I didn't say anything."
Baoyu smiled and said, "I'll give you a torreya to eat!
I heard it all. "
The two were talking, and saw Zijuan coming in, Baoyu smiled and said, "Zijuan, I will make a bowl of your good tea."
Zi Juan said: "Do we have good ones?
The better had to wait for the attacker to come. "
Dai Yu said, "Just ignore him.
You scoop me water first. "
Zi Juan said: "He is a guest, so naturally he makes tea first and then scoops water."
With that, I poured the tea.
Baoyu smiled and said, "Good girl!
‘If you share your sentimental lady with the mandarin tent, how can you be willing to make you fold the bed? ’"
Daiyu was immediately anxious, she put her face down and said, "What did you say?"
Baoyu smiled and said, "Why did I say something?"
Daiyu cried: "Now Xinxing, he heard the village dialect from outside and told me to listen to it; he read the bastard book and made fun of me.
I became a relief for men. "
While crying, while getting out of bed, go out.
Baoyu panicked, and hurriedly rushed up and said, "Good sister, I should die for a while, don't tell me anyway!
If I dare to say these things, a boil grows on my mouth and my tongue is rotten. "
As he was talking, I saw Xiren approaching and said, "Go back and put on your clothes. Master calls you."
After Baoyu heard it, he felt like a thunder, and he didn't care about anything else, so he hurried back to get dressed.
After leaving the park, I saw Baking waiting in front of the second gate.
Baoyu asked, "Do you know why the master called me?"
Baking said: "Master, come out soon, you will see you anyway, you will know where you are."
On the one hand, while urging Baoyu.
Turning the hall, Baoyu was still suspicious in his heart. He only heard a burst of laughter from the corner of the wall. When he turned around, Xue Pan clapped his hands and jumped out and smiled: "Or the uncle called you, you are willing to come out so fast!"
Baking also smiled and knelt down.
Baoyu was stunned for a long time, when Fang wanted to come over, it was Xue Pan who coaxed him out.
Xue Pan hurriedly made a beating, and begged: "Don't be difficult for the kid, I want him to go."
Baoyu couldn't do it anymore, so she had to smile and asked, "It's nothing more than you coax me, how do you say it is the master?
I told my aunt to comment on this theory, can it be made? "
Xue Pan hurriedly said: "My dear brother, I was asking you to come out soon, so I forgot the word taboo. You have to coax me and say my father, and it will be over."
Baoyu said: "Oh!
Damn it more and more. "
Xiang Baking said: "Rebellious bastard, what are you doing on your knees?"
Baking kowtows quickly.
Xue Pan said, "If it weren't for it, I wouldn't dare to be alarmed: Just because it's my birthday on the third day of the next month, who knows Lao Hu and Lao Cheng, I don't know where they found them: so thick, so long, and crispy. Fresh lotus root; such a big watermelon; such a long, such a big Siamese pig and fish with scented cypress as a tribute to the country of Siam.
You said these four gifts, are they rare?
The fish and pigs are not expensive and rare. How did he grow these lotus roots and melons!
I honored my mother first, and sent some to your old lady and aunt in a hurry.
Now I have some. I'm afraid it will be a blessing if I want to eat it myself. I think you are the only one worthy of eating besides me.
So I invite you here.
But a kid who sang a piece of music is here again. How can I have fun with you all day? "
