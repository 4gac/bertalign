Wei Xiaobao waited for Kangxi down from the upper study, and went to the imperial dining room.
After a while, Boss Qian brought four guys and carried two big fat pigs that had been cleansed and peeled. Each mouthful of meat weighed 300 kilograms. He said to Wei Xiaobao, "Daddy Gui, your old man got up early in the morning. , Eating this Poria Huadiao pig is the most beneficial, it is best to cut freshly roasted.
The villain sends a bite of pigs to your old man’s room. Tomorrow morning, your old man can cut and roast and eat. If you can’t finish it, you can make bacon in the kitchen. "
Wei Xiaobao knew that he must have deep meaning, so he said: "You are thoughtful.
Then follow me. "
Boss Qian left one of the pigs in the kitchen, and carried the other to Wei Xiaobao's house.
The residence of the supervising eunuch of Shangshan was similar to that of the imperial kitchen. After the fat pig was carried into the room, Wei Xiaobao ordered the eunuch to lead the pig-carrying staff to wait in the kitchen. After the three of them left, he closed the door.
Boss Qian asked in a low voice, "Master Wei Xiang, are there no one else in the house?"
Wei Xiaobao shook his head.
Boss Qian leaned over and gently turned the Guangzhu over, only to see a few pigskins on the open part of the belly, sealing the slit.
Wei Xiaobao thought: "There must be something ancient monster hidden in this fat pig belly. Could it be weapons or something? Heaven and Earth would want to kill people in the palace?"
Can not help but heart pounding.
Seeing that Boss Qian tore off the pigskin, pulled the pork belly away with both hands, and gently hugged a mass of things out.
Wei Xiaobao exclaimed "Huh," and saw that he was holding out a person.
Boss Qian placed the man horizontally underground.
I saw this person was thin, with long hair, but she was a 14-five-year-old girl, wearing a thin single shirt, her eyes closed, she didn't move, but her chest was slightly undulating.
Wei Xiaobao was surprised and asked in a low voice, "Who is this little girl?
Why did you bring her here? "
Boss Qian said, "This is the princess of the Mu Palace."
Wei Xiaobao was even more surprised. He opened his eyes wide and said, "The princess of the Mu Palace?"
Boss Qian said: "Exactly.
A sister of Mu Wangfu's little father-in-law.
They took the third brother Xu abducted, and we captured the princess empress as a mortgage and taught them not to touch the third brother Xu. "
Wei Xiaobao was surprised and delighted, and said: "Cunning plan, wonderful plan!
How did you catch her? "
Boss Qian said: "Yesterday Xu Tianchuan and Third Brother Xu were tied up. Wei Xiang and his elder brothers went to Yangliu Hutong for the second time, and his subordinates went out to inquire about the news. They wanted to know the people in Mu Palace, except for Yangliu Hutong. In addition, is there any other place to stay? Did Brother Xu imprison them there? I want to know who they are in the capital. If we really want to do it, we must first have a foundation.
This inquiries, hey, there are still a lot of people from the Mu Palace. The Mu Family Young Master took the lead and led a large number of experts in the Palace. "
Wei Xiaobao frowned and said, "Damn!
How many brothers does Aokitang have in Beijing?
Can you beat them one out of ten? "
Boss Qian said: "Lord Wei Xiang, don't worry.
Prince Mu Mansion came to Beijing this time, not to fight with our Tiandihui.
It turned out that Wu Yingxiong, the eldest son of Wu Sangui, came to the capital. "
Wei Xiaobao nodded and said, "Prince Mu Mansion is going to assassinate this traitor named Wu?"
Boss Qian said: "Yes.
Wei Xiang mainly feeds things like gods.
The big traitors and the little traitors are in Yunnan and can't move their hands. Once they leave Yunnan, they have a chance.
But this little traitor is naturally well-prepared, and there are many martial arts masters around him. It is not easy to kill him.
The people in Prince Mu's Mansion really had another residence. The subordinates checked and found that those people were not at home, but there was no trace of Xu Sange in the house. Only the little girl and the two women who served her stayed in the house. Great opportunity..."
Wei Xiaobao said: "So you just took the sheep and backhanded the pig and caught her?"
Boss Qian smiled and said, "Exactly.
Although this little girl is young, Prince Mu's Mansion regards her as a phoenix. As long as this little princess is in our hands, Brother Xu will be as stable as Mount Tai, not afraid that they will not serve her well. "
Wei Xiaobao said, "Big Brother Qian has done a great job."
Boss Qian said: "Thank you Wei Xiangzhu for the praise."
Wei Xiaobao said, "We got the little princess, but what?"
As he said, he glanced at the girl lying underground, and said in his heart: "This little girl looks very beautiful."
Boss Qian said: "If this matter is said to be big or not, it must be handled according to Master Wei Xiang."
Wei Xiaobao pondered: "What do you say?"
Although he was getting along with the people of Tiandihui for a while, he had already felt their temper.
These people respectfully call themselves the incense lord, and they are full of mouthfuls waiting for the incense lord to tell Yunyun. In fact, everyone has an idea in their stomachs, and only hopes to get their own approval, so everything will be pushed on the head of Wei Xiang. Will not play a major role.
The way he dealt with it was to ask: "What do you say?"
Boss Qian said: "At the moment, the only way to hide this princess is to hide it in a safe place, so that the people in the Mu Palace cannot find it.
This time, the Mu family came to the capital quite a lot. Although it was to kill the traitor Wu Yingxiong, we killed their people and Brother Xu took them again. At this moment, we will find every place in the world. It must be nailed tightly.
We took a piss and fart, I'm afraid that everyone in the Mu Palace would know. "
Wei Xiaobao sneered, thinking that Boss Qian’s talk was very good, and it fits his own stomach, and smiled: "Big Brother Qian, let's sit down and discuss it slowly."
Boss Qian said: "Yes, yes, thank you Xiangzhu."
Sitting on a chair, he continued: "The subordinates hid the little princess in a pig's belly and brought them into the palace. One was to hide from the guards of the palace gate, and the other was to hide from the people of Mu Palace. The ears and eyes.
His grandma's, Grandpa Mu's subordinates, I'm afraid there are really a few powerful people, so we must guard against it.
If the little princess hadn't been hiding in the palace, it would be impossible not to snatch them back. "
Wei Xiaobao said, "You said you want to hide the little princess in the palace?"
Boss Qian said: "The subordinates don't dare to say that. Everything depends on the master Wei Xiang.
Hidden in the palace is of course the safest place in the world.
No matter how many masters in Prince Mu's Mansion are, they are no match for the Ouchi guards.
The little princess would be in the palace, not to mention that they could not think of it and couldn't find out. Even if they knew, how could they be able to rush into the palace to save people?
If they can enter the palace to rescue the little princess, then even the Emperor Tartar can be kidnapped.
There is absolutely no such truth in the world.
However, his subordinates acted boldly and did not ask Master Wei Xiang for instructions beforehand. He brought the little princess into the palace without authorization, adding a lot of danger and trouble to Master Wei Xiang, which was really damnable. "
Wei Xiaobao said in his heart: "You brought people in. You said you deserve to die, but you didn't die.
It was indeed a good plan to hide the little princess in the palace. The people of Prince Mu's Palace couldn't think of it, and they couldn't save it.
If you are bold, don't I have the courage? "
He smiled and said: "Your strategy is very good, I will hide the little princess here."
Boss Qian said: "Yes, yes, Lord Wei Xiang said that this thing will work, then it will definitely work.
The subordinates thought that after the matter was over, the little princess would always let them back.
They learned that the princess empress was living in the palace these days, and she did not humiliate her identity. If she is always locked in the cellar of the small slaughter house and smells the odor of cattle blood and pig blood, it would be too sorry. "
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "Feed her some Poria, Codonopsis, Huadiao, and eggs every day."
Boss Qian chuckled and said, "Furthermore, although the young princess is young, she is always a woman. Living with us stinky men is a hindrance to reputation. It does not matter if we are with Wei Xiangzhu."
Wei Xiaobao was startled and asked: "Why?"
Boss Qian said: "Wei Xiangzhu is also young, not to mention... He also works in the palace, naturally... it's nothing."
Speaking hesitating, some inconvenience to export.
When Wei Xiaobao saw him look embarrassed, he thought about it, and then realized: "So you said that I was an eunuch, so the little princess gave me care, and she has no problem with her reputation.
You don't know that my eunuch is a fake. "
Only because he is not a real eunuch can he understand after thinking about it, otherwise Boss Qian would understand the first sentence.
Boss Qian asked, "Will Master Wei Xiang enter the bedroom?"
Wei Xiaobao nodded.
Boss Qian leaned over and picked up the little princess, walked back in, and put it on the bed.
The room originally had a big bed and a small bed. After Hai Dafu died, Wei Xiaobao had asked someone to lift the small bed out.
He had a lot of secrets and did not ask the little eunuch to live in the house to serve.
Boss Qian said: "When the subordinate brought the little princess into the palace, he had already clicked the Shentang and Yanggang points on her vest, and also the Tianzhu points on the back of her neck, so that she could not move and could not speak. .
Wei Xiang can release her acupuncture points by letting her eat, but it is better to tap the loops on her legs to prevent her from running away.
The people of Prince Mu's Mansion have very high martial arts, and this little girl doesn't know much about martial arts, but she can't help it. "
Wei Xiaobao wanted to ask him what Shentang acupoints and Huantiao acupoints are, and how to acupuncture and relieve acupoints. However, after thinking about it, he is the master of Qingmutang incense and a disciple of Master Rudder, so he can't even click and relieve acupuncture points. Didn't the subordinates look down too much?
It's not difficult to deal with a little girl anyway, nodded and said, "I see."
Boss Qian said, "Lord Wei Xiang, please borrow a knife."
Wei Xiaobao thought: "What do you want a knife for?"
Take out the dagger from the boot bucket and hand it to him.
Boss Qian took it and swiped it on the pig's back. He didn't expect the dagger to be sharp and sharp, cutting pork like tofu, cutting it down with a sword until it reached the handle.
Boss Qian was taken aback and praised: "Good sword!"
Cut off two slices of tenderloin, two front legs, and said, "Master Wei Xiang saves the barbecue to eat, and the rest tell the little father-in-laws to carry it back to the kitchen.
The subordinates are now leaving, and the subordinates will report to Wei Xiang at any time about the meeting. "
Wei Xiaobao took the dagger and said, "Okay!"
He glanced at the little princess lying on the bed, and said, "This little girl sleeps quite peacefully."
He wanted to say: "This little girl has been in the palace for a long time. It's too dangerous. If people find out, it's terrible."
But are the heroes who want to meet the world afraid of danger?
When these words are said, they can't help being underestimated.
When Boss Qian went back to the kitchen, Wei Xiaobao hurriedly bolted the door and checked the window again. There was no gap before he sat on the bed and went to see the little princess. She was looking at the top of the bed with her round eyes. Seeing Wei Xiaobao coming, he hurriedly closed his eyes.
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "You can't speak, you can't move. You can lie here quietly. You are the best."
Seeing that her clothes were not dirty, I thought Boss Qian had washed the fat pig's belly very clean without leaving any blood stains, so he pulled it over and covered her.
I saw her cheeks were white, not half bloody, and her long eyelashes kept trembling, thinking that she was very scared in her heart, and smiled: "Don't be afraid, I won't kill you.
After a few days, I will let you out. "
The little princess opened his eyes, glanced at him, and closed his eyes again.
Wei Xiaobao pondered: "Your Palace of Mu is so majestic on the rivers and lakes. That day, the Bai Hansong of your house on the North Subei Road was so big that I didn't look at Lao Tzu in the slightest. At the moment, it wasn't that my people were killed. .
His grandma's..."
Thinking of this, he stretched out his hand and saw that the black circle on his wrist hadn't retreated, and he still felt a pain. He said in his heart: "Bai Hanfeng is dead brother, there is nowhere to vent, and I almost broke my bones.
Unexpectedly, the princess empress of Prince Mu’s Palace fell into my hands. Lao Tzu beats and scolds if he wants to beat or scold if he wants. You can’t move halfway, haha, haha! "
Thinking of my pride, I couldn't help laughing.
The little princess heard the laughter and opened his eyes to see why he was laughing.
Wei Xiaobao smiled and said, "You are the princess empress, it's amazing, aren't you?
Your grandma's, I won't put you in my eyes! "
Stepped forward, grabbed her right ear, lifted it three times, pinched her nose, twisted it twice, and laughed.
Tears flowed from the closed eyes of the little princess, and two rows of tears rolled down from his cheeks.
Wei Xiaobao shouted: "Don't cry!
I told you not to cry, not to cry! "
The little princess' tears flowed even more.
Wei Xiaobao cursed: "Mom Spicy, Niang Pi, you are still stubborn!
Open your eyes and look at me! "
The little princess closed his eyes tighter.
Wei Xiaobao said: "Ha, you still say that this is your Mu Palace, your grandma's, Liu Baifang and the four generals in your family, what the hell is there, and one day they hit Lao Tzu's hands, all of them were cut to pieces. sauce."
Yelled: "Can you open your eyes?"
The little princess closed his eyes vigorously again.
Wei Xiaobao said, "Okay, you won't open your eyes. What use is this pair of stinky eyes?
It's better to dig it out and let Laozi drink. "
Lifting the dagger, laying the blade flat, dragged her eyelids a few times.
The little princess fought a cold war all over, but still did not open his eyes.
Wei Xiaobao couldn't help her, and said, "If you don't open your eyes, I just want you to open your eyes. My brothers are exhausted. It's up to you to see if your princess lady is good, or my little gangster or beggar is good. .
I won't come to dig your eyes for the time being, I dig your eyes, but you have won, and you can never look at me.
I'm going to carve some patterns on your cheek with a sharp knife, a little turtle on the left face, and a pile of cow dung on the right.
When you get scarred in the future, when you go down the street, thousands of people will gather to look at the diorama. Everyone says:'Beautiful, beautiful, come and see the little beauty in Mu Palace, there is a bastard on the left and right A pile of cow dung on his face.
"Can you open your eyes? "
The little princess couldn't move his whole body, only opening his eyes and closing his eyes could make up his mind. Hearing Wei Xiaobao's words, his eyes became tighter and tighter.
Wei Xiaobao said to himself: "It turns out that this stinky flower girl doesn't think her face is beautiful, and wants me to dress up on her face. Okay, I will carve a turtle first!"
I opened the inkstone on the table, rubbed the ink, and dipped the ink with the pen.
These pens and inkstones are all belonging to her husband. Wei Xiaobao has never grasped the barrel of a pen in his life. At this time, holding the pen is like holding chopsticks. He drew a tortoise on the left face of Xiaojunzhu.
The little princess' tears flowed down, and an ink mark flowed out on the tortoise's strokes.
Wei Xiaobao said: "I first make a look with a pen, and then use a knife to carve, just like someone carves a seal.
Yes, yes, the princess lady, after we have carved it, I took you to Chang'anmen Street and shouted: ‘Which guest officer wants to print the tortoise?
One copy of the three text money! ’
I painted your face with black ink, and someone gave me three cents, and I printed it on your face with a piece of white paper. It was a turtle, very fast!
One hundred sheets can be printed in one day.
Three hundred copper coins are enough to spend. "
While talking nonsense, he peeked at the face of the little princess, and saw her eyelashes trembling, obviously angry and scared.
He was very proud and said: "Well, there is a pile of cow dung carved on the right cheek, but no one pays to buy cow dung. It's better to carve a pig. It's fat and stupid. Business must be good."
He lifted the pen and stroked her right cheek. The thing she painted has four feet and one tail. It doesn't matter whether it looks like a cat or a dog.
He put down the brush, took a pair of scissors for cutting silver, gently placed the scissors on the left cheek of the little princess, and shouted: "Don't open your eyes anymore, I'm going to cut flowers!
I will carve the tortoise first, but the fat pig is not busy carving. "
The little princess was in tears, but he just refused to open his eyes.
Wei Xiaobao was helpless and refused to admit defeat, so he stroked the tip of the scissors lightly on her face.
The cutting tip was actually very blunt. Although the little princess' skin was tender, it didn't hurt her the slightest, but in shock, she only said that the little villain really used a knife to carve flowers on her face, and fainted in a panic.
Seeing her look different, Wei Xiaobao was shocked for fear that he was scared to death. He hurriedly stretched out his hand to sniff her. Fortunately, he still breathed, and said, "The smelly girl pretended to be dead!"
Thinking: "You won't open your eyes when you die. Did I lose to you?
Let's ride a donkey to read the songbook, and wait and see, Wei Xiaobao will never be folded into your stinky girl. "
I took a piece of damp cloth, wiped the black ink from her cheeks, and wiped it three times to make it clean.
But seeing her long eyebrows and long eyebrows, a small mouth and a really beautiful face, she said to herself: "You are the princess empress, you must look down on me as a little eunuch in your heart, and I also look down on you. Isn't everyone straight?"
After a while, the little princess woke up slowly, and when he opened his eyes, he saw that Wei Xiaobao's eyes were no more than a foot apart from hers. He was staring at her fiercely. He was surprised and hurriedly closed his eyes.
Wei Xiaobao laughed and said, "You finally opened your eyes and saw me. Lao Tzu won, didn't you?"
He felt triumphant, and he was happy, but the little princess couldn’t speak. He was a bit disappointed. He wanted to solve her acupuncture points, but he didn’t know how to do it. He said, "You have acupuncture points for someone. If you can’t solve them, you cannot eat. Don't you starve to death?
I wanted to solve it for you, but the method of relieving acupuncture points, which I learned before, can be forgotten now.
Do you know how?
If you can't, then lie down and be a zombie, don't move, if you can, blink your eyes three times. "
He looked at the little princess intently, and saw that her eyes remained motionless. After a while, suddenly her eyes blinked slowly three times.
Wei Xiaobao was overjoyed and said, "I only say that since the people in the palace of Mu are surnamed Mu, all of them must be wood, dumb and knowing nothing. It turns out that you, a little wood, can solve acupuncture points."
He picked her up, sat on the chair, and said, "Look, I am pointing at all parts of your body. If you are pointing right, you will blink three times. If you don't point right, your eyes will open wide and even move. Can't move.
When I find the point where the acupuncture points are resolved, I will untie the acupuncture points for you, understand?
Blink if you understand. "
The little princess blinked three times.
